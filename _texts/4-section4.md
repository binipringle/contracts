You asked me to ascertain whether there was consideration when Doug promised his brother Paul that if Paul cared for their elderly mother until she passed away, Doug would pay for the expenses incurred in taking care of her, and Paul promised to care for their mother until their mother died. 

The doctrine of consideration requires that the exchange of promises between parties be based on notions of fairness, reliance, and efficiency. For a contract to be enforceable, in addition to their being assent (offer and acceptance), there must be consideration. For a court to find that there was consideration in promises exchanged, each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and must be given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. A fundamental principle in contract law, coming from Neo-classical economic theory, is that courts do not like to intervene in the adequacy of the deal and assume that both parties are acting rationally, freely and reasonably, and that they agree on the price.

Courts do not examine adequacy of consideration. However, nominal consideration (false or sham motive) is not good consideration. While consideration must be sufficient (there must be a bargained-for exchange of promises), courts do not look at adequacy. Instead, courts assume that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests, and further assumes that the court’s assumption that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests encourages the free flow of commerce. The bargain theory thus permits sellers to charge what the market will "bear" even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites, assuming that if individuals from these groups agree to pay more for goods this is because they want to pay that much, not because they need the goods. To determine whether there was consideration, courts perform a two-step analysis using the paradigms of legal detriment and bargained-for.

The first sub-issue is whether there was legal detriment. For there to be legal detriment, both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do. Here, Doug had the legal right not to pay for the expenses incurred in taking care of his and Paul’s mother, and Paul had the legal right not to care for their mother. Therefore, legal detriment is satisfied.

The second sub-issue is whether the exchange between Doug and Paul was bargained for. The Bargained-for test requires that the promisee’s promise be sought by the promisor in exchange for the return promise and given by the promisee in exchange for that promise. In other words, both parties must be making their promise so as to get the return promise from the other party. When the parties’ motives or reasons for making their promises are in dispute, courts apply the objective test. A party’s motivation to get the return promise from the other party does not have to be the only motive or even the predominant motive, and the exchange can be part bargain, part gift.

Here, Doug promised to pay for the expenses incurred in taking care of his and Paul’s mother until she passed away so as to get Paul’s return promise of taking care of their mother. Paul made his promise to take care of his and Doug’s mother until she passed away so as to get Doug’s return promise of paying for the expenses incurred in taking care of her. Therefore, Paul would argue that the promises exchanged between him and Doug were bargained for.

Doug would argue that the promises exchanged between him and Paul were not bargained for because Doug’s promise to pay for the expenses incurred in taking care of their elderly mother was a gift. However, there is no evidence that the money Doug was going to give Paul in reimbursement for expenses incurred during the care of their mother was a gift. In addition, Doug would argue that Paul’s promise to care for their elderly mother until she passed away was not motivated by seeking a return promise of money from Doug because Paul continued to take care of their elderly mother after 13 months when Doug stopped paying the expenses and continued to care for their mother for an additional 16 months until she passed away. Paul would likely argue that his motivation in promising to care for their mother was partly to fulfill his moral duty and partly to be reimbursed by his brother for expenses incurred.

Courts consider mixed motives valid under bargained-for as long as part of the exchange is bargained for. Evidence suggests that Paul and Doug made promises to each other partly to get the return promises. Here, Paul wanted, at least to some extent, to get Doug’s return promise to pay for the expenses of their mother’s care because he accepted reimbursement for these costs. Courts have found that a Defendant’s mere acceptance of payment showed that Defendant’s motivation in making their promise was to receive that payment.

Evidence also suggests that Doug wanted, at least to some extent, Paul’s return promise of taking care of their mother until she passed away because he asked Paul to care for her and reimbursed Paul for the expenses incurred in her care. It is possible that Paul was partly motivated by moral duty and that Doug’s payment of the expenses incurred in the care of their mother was part gift. Therefore, since both parties appear to make a promise so as to get the return promise, even though they may also appear to be making a gift and acting out of moral duty, a court will likely find that the bargained-for element is satisfied.

Therefore, there was consideration because there was legal detriment and the promises exchanged by Doug and Paul were bargained for.
