# I Intro to contract law

[Glossary](https://binipringle.github.io/contracts/texts/glossary/)

## Sources of Law

- **Common law** - determines what constitutes a contract - RST is restatement of common law
- **Legislation**
- **UCC Art. 2 - Uniform Commercial Code** governs the sale of goods. Services are not governed by UCC. Real Estate is not covered by UCC. UCC has a separate set of law from common law. If something is a good, UCC applies.
- **UN CISG** - like UCC but for international sale of goods
- **Commentary**
- **Restatement (Second) of Contracts** - not law; summary of law; very influential (common law)
- **Law reviews, treatises, etc.**

Broad steps of analysis: Is there a contract? If contract, is it enforceable? What are the terms? Did a party breach? If there's breach, what are the damages?

Why should the law enforce any promises?

1. Because of people's expectations; people expect that a contract will be enforced. If I sell you a car we can start relying on the agreement of the sale of the car. We want to protect the expectations of the parties.

2. We want to protect contracting for business. One thing that contract law doesn't do is penalize people for breaching contracts. This is not criminal law. We don't want to punish people for not observing contracts. We want to compensate the party who suffered.

**Hypo:** I rent you an apartment. You agree to rent it for 2000. You decide to go to California so you breach. Apartment empty for a month. Then I rent it for 3000. Should you compensate me for my loss due to breach of contract?

Reasons to enforce a promise:

- Both agreed (assent)
- Exchange is important as opposed to gifts
- Reliance
- unjust enrichment (dog hypo)

Reasons not to enforce a promise:

- gift (no exchange)
- no real promise
- against public policy
- no assent

## The Bargain Principle

Bargain Theory involves:

- Exchange / reciprocity (consideration) +
- Assent (offer and acceptance)
- Assumption: Bargains are motivated by self-interest

Underlying policy concerns:

- Fairness
- Reliance
- Efficiency

*See Section 2: problem posted on TWEN (What promises should the law enforce?)*

**Hypo** illustrating the blurred line between exchange and Gift: Uncle promises to pay nephew $5000 if he quits drinking and smoking until he turns 21; nephew quits; turns 21; $5000 not paid; nephew sues. Does he have a claim under the bargain principle? (Was the promise part of an exchange or a promise to give a gift?)   

**Kirksey v. Kirksey** (Supreme Court of Alabama 1845)

- Issue: Whether promise made to plaintiff by plaintiff's brother-in-law (defendant) that if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family" was a contract.
- Why issue matters: Issue matters because it raises the question of what elements are necessary for a promise to be a legal contract.
- Holding: Promise was a gift (no exchange)
- Factual arguments in support of that holding: plaintiff did not agree to do anything in exchange for living on defendant's farm.
- Factual counterarguments: there was exchange because plaintiff worked on defendant's farm.
- If I wanted to make this more clearly enforceable, I would rephrase the promise as "if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family [until a specified time] [in exchange for her doing work on his farm]."  

## Theoretical perspectives

**Neo-Classical Economics:** Economic theory most closely associated with Bargain Theory (a deal's a deal etc.). Values efficiency and profit-making. Assumptions (pp 37-38):

- people act in their own self interest
- people act rationally
- people have access to perfect info
- people and resources are freely movable
- there are no artificial restrictions to entry to the market

As social justice lawyers we will consider: how can these assumptions be challenged?

**Socioeconomics (counter economic theory):**

- assumes we can't adequately understand economic behavior by the assumptions of autonomy, rationality, and efficiency
- considers social norms, disparate bargaining power, sexism, racism, educational inequalities and other inequalities
- recognizes the capacity for empathy

**(Legal) Formalism**

- words rule. They have a distinct meaning.

**Contextual approach**  

- the objective test

## Three principles of contract lawyers

- Bargain theory (agreement to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations)
- Reliance theory (involves promises to give gifts. Seeks to protect those who reasonably rely on others.)
- Restitution theory (one ought to pay for any benefit unjustly retained. Goal is to prevent unjust enrichment.)

# II Objectivity

Note: As a general rule, oral contracts are enforceable (except if they are fraud); there is no general common law rule requiring written evidence of a contract. (82)

## IIa Objective theory of interpretation

**Definition:** The "objective theory" of interpretation provides that words and conduct should be interpreted as a “reasonable person” would interpret them.

Used to determine:

- whether there was an offer
- whether there was acceptance

**Charles R Embry v Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods Company** Missouri Court of Appeals 105 S.W. 777 (1907)

- **Issue:** Whether the appellant and the respondent entered into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Parties’ Arguments:**
-	 Charles Embry ("the appellant") is arguing that following the expiration of his employment contract at Hargadine, he was reemployed by McKittrick, the president of the respondent company ("the respondent company president" or "the president") to work for another year.  
-	McKittrick is arguing that he never reemployed Embry.    
- **Rule:** If the words or acts of two parties would be understood by a reasonable person to manifest the intention of both parties to enter into a contract, a contract is created, regardless of whether a party did not intend to enter into the contract so long as a reasonable person would find that the inner intention is not embodied in the words used by or acts of the parties. (62 4th para)

**R.L.M. Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc.**

- **Issue:** Whether custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement between the parties.
- **Rule:** Contract assent can be express or implied. Agreements can be implied in whole or in part through conduct alone or through usage of trade. *See RST Contracts Section 4* An implied agreement concerning the issue of transferability may arise in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary if custom or practice in the industry provides for such an understanding.
- **Holding:** The court found that custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement between the parties.
- **Factual arguments in support of that holding:** In the RLM case, the custom in the industry was that if you transfer a business you also transfer distribution rights. So a reasonable person would believe that here too. So absent any other facts a party would be reasonable to believe that parties were following custom. If you don't follow custom you have to be explicit.
- **Factual counterarguments:** Transferability was not explicit.

The very fact that you are using the objective test means that there was no express intent - no "I promise to sell you my car" - implied agreement can arise by virtue of conduct and custom or practice in the industry - use objective test.

## IIb Policy

Differences between objective and subjective tests:

The “objective theory” assumes that a standard of shared meaning already exists or that one ought to exist, and this assumption is controversial. (59)  When resolving disputes, courts using the objective approach determine the meaning of words, conduct and circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable person. Under the "subjective theory" of interpretation the court would evaluate what both people actually thought (by indirect evidence) andd the court would only find a contract if there had been a "meeting of the minds."  *This was the approach taken by the trial court in Embry.* Subjective test allows for differences between people. It prevents contracts being formed by accident.

## Three variations on the reasonable person test

**(1) Universal reasonable person:** Relevant evidence; just specific words being interpreted. Words have set meaning. Positioned outside of the history and circumstances of the parties and who sees and hears the words and conduct apart from the context in which they were uttered or performed. Associated with a formalist approach to law and legal interpretation not generally followed today. Some impact in contract interpretation (see chapter nine). Only relevant evidence is the specific words and content being interpreted. If the court were using this test in Embry, they would only be looking at the words McKittrick said, not context. Embry's request is context. The context and timing led the court to find that there was a context. Critique of universal: it favors the powerful party.

**(2) Positioned reasonable person test** interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a "universal" observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication. *This was used by the court in Embry.* Relevant evidence includes evidence of the history of the parties' relationship and of the circumstances surrounding the communications.

Turn the facts into factors. If you take these facts and turn them into factors you can use in the next case, then you can use them.

**Factors**

- clarity of representation
- seriousness
- definiteness / level of detail
- context
- relationship of the parties
- prior dealings
- industry custom
- urgent need / time sensitivity?
- Etc.

What was said? And what would that lead a reasonable person to believe? Use factors.

U.S. Steel Hypo

**(3) Socially situated reasonableness analysis** interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a "universal" observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication but who also has the social identity of the recipient. Draws from the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (UN CISG), which provides that statements and conduct of contracting parties should be interpreted accordidng to the parties' own shared meanings, but if these cannot be ascertained, then the statements should be interpreted according to the understanding that "a reasonable person *of the same kind* (including nationality, culture, religion and the like) as the other party would have had in the same circumstances." Relevant evidence includes the history and circumstances of the communication and also the practices of the parties' trades or communities and their own experiences in negotiations of this sort. Critics of the socially situated theory argue that it is better to challenge class and other bias in the objective theory than to invite judges to indulge in stereotypical versions of others' perspectives. Very essentializing.

The critique of the reasonable person test whichever way you look at it is the problem of bias, of essentialiizing. Race. Gender. Class. The objective test is the test that courts use, because it's more rational than the subjective test. So we have to figure out how to use it in the least harmful way.

The key is that either a reasonable person interpreted in a way or *should have* interpreted it in that way.

**Revisit Local 1330 v. US Steel**

- Workers take wage concessions etc. thinking it will keep steel mills open andd save their jobs. Company decides to shut down the steel mills. 4000 workers lost their job. Sued based on alleged promise off company to keep the plants open as long as they remain profitable Workers claimed that there was a promise basedd on various statements of the company execs. "Your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate." Enforceable promise? Both sides could be argued. Here the court took a very narrow focus.
- If you wanted to say yes there was a promise, you look at the relationships, how people had very little power. Make the caase by putting yourself in the shoes of the workers, what they heard and how they world interrpret it.

**Using the objective test:**

Questions to ask: How did the court determine what a reasonable person would have thought? What facts did the court rely on? What facts support a counterargument that a reasonable person would not think McKittrick was agreeing to renew the contract?

**Hypo** from Death of a Salesman:

1. Suppose that Howard's father said to Willy, "i'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town."
2. years later, Howard has died and Willy doesn't want to travel anymore. Was this a promise?
3. Would a reasonable person in Willy's shoes think that a promise was made?

"I'm sure" is often used colloquially to mean the exact opposite: I'm not sure. Use factors. Statement lacks clarity and definiteness (i.e. "a place")

Relationship of the parties. An employee and an employer. An employee asking a question of his employer.

**Another Hypo** from Death of a Salesman:

- Willy doesn't want to travel anymore. Asks Howard (son of the old owner) for an office job in town. (see slide)

**Hypo**

- People drinking in a bar. One contracts to sell their farm to the other for $50,000. Farm was really worth a lot more. Next day seller refuses to sell saying they didn't really promise (just kidding). Enforceable promise? Yes. Here we don't have facts that say they were incapacitated because they were drunk, so we assume they had capacity.

Text pp 116-127 (very top)

Working with Rules - Sources of Law and Theoretical perspective

In class, we will discuss Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as a source of authority of contract law.  How does the UCC differ from the RST in terms of its authority and scope?

Read UCC §§ 2-206 & 2-207(1).  Would Panhandle have been decided differently if it had been a sale of goods and subject to Article 2 of the UCC?  If so, how?

What justifies the common law mirror image rule? Under what circumstances does this rule protect the offeror?  Under what circumstance might it create incentives for opportunistic behavior?  Why does the UCC reject the mirror image rule? Generally speaking, is the UCC rule more generous to offerors or offerees?

In class, we will discuss the contrast between Formalism and Legal Realism as illustrated by the difference between the RST and the UCC.

## IVb Neo-Classical economic theory

It is said that courts won’t look at the adequacy or fairness of the consideration. Should sellers be permitted to charge what the market will bear in all cases?  What if that means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods?  What if it means charging women more than men or BIPOC consumers more than white consumers? Should it matter if members of those groups agree to pay more?

Theoretical perspective and Close Case Reading

What is the “primitive stage of formalism” that the Wood court is rejecting? Why is it being rejected?

What is Cardozo telling us about the relationship between the parties in the case? For whose benefit is the term implied?  Who was vulnerable under the contract as written?

## IVc Critical legal theory

The Paula Childress story beginning on p 226 is optional reading. It provides an account of the role of class, race, and poverty in the dehumanization of people who are poor. Does this attitude help explain the devaluation of the claim in the Lawrence case?

Would the outcome of Lawrence change if Ethel Lawrence had been a paying patient? What does this tell you about who is the least protected by the consideration doctrine?

What would have been a more persuasive way for the clinic to make the case that there was no consideration in Lawrence?

Working with Facts

Consider the language the lower court used in characterizing the Whiteheads and the Sterns.  What differences are evident in tone and word choice? What language does the appellate court use in characterizing the Whiteheads and the Sterns?  Are there similar differences in tone and word choice?

Consider the role that these choices play in the process of legal analysis and the courts’ decisions.  How do these choices inform your reading of the case?

## VIIai Theoretical perspective

Consider any discomfort you may have with either the lower court or the appellate opinion.  Can you categorize your objection in terms of one or more of the theories we studied?
