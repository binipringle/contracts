## Sources of law

- **Common law** determines what constitutes a contract (RST restates common law)
- **Legislation**
- **Restatement (Second) of Contracts (common law)** is not law; summary of law; very influential
- **UCC Art. 2 - Uniform Commercial Code** governs the sale of goods. Does not govern services nor Real Estate. UCC separate from common law. If something is a good, UCC applies.
- **UN CISG** is like UCC but for international sale of goods
- **Commentary**
- **Law reviews, treatises, etc.**

## Bargain principle

The bargain principle includes the central belief that an agreement to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations. The motto "a deal is a deal" is a core tenet of the bargain principle. There is disagreement as to whether a deal is really a deal if it is made under conditions of coercion, duress, or inequality of power and resources. Rationales that justify the bargain principle include the belief that when two parties enter into a deal both sides are committed, one or both parties will count on the deal and rely on the deal to make a living, commercial exchange is crucial to a capitalist economy, deals are crucial to a free market system, and a free market system is essential to individual freedom.      

## Theoretical perspectives

**Neo-Classical Economics:** Economic theory most closely associated with bargain theory. "A deal's a deal." Values efficiency and profit-making. Assumptions:[^1]

[^1]:As social justice lawyers we will consider: how can these assumptions be challenged?

- people act in their own self interest
- people act rationally
- people have access to perfect info
- people and resources are freely movable
- there are no artificial restrictions to entry to the market

**Socioeconomics (counter economic theory):** Assumes we can't adequately understand economic behavior by the assumptions of autonomy, rationality, and efficiency. Considers social norms, disparate bargaining power, sexism, racism, educational inequalities and other inequalities. Recognizes the capacity for empathy.

**(Legal) Formalism:** Words rule. They have a distinct meaning.

**Contextual approach:** The objective test

---

# Objective theory of contract interpretation

## Objective theory approach

The "objective theory" of interpretation provides that words and conduct should be interpreted as a “reasonable person” would interpret them. The “objective theory” assumes that a standard of shared meaning already exists or that one ought to exist. This assumption is controversial. However, for lack of a better system, courts generally use the objective standard to determine the meaning of words, conduct and circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable person. The reasonable person standard is used to determine (1) whether there was an offer, and (2) whether there was acceptance.

**R.L.M. Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc.** 723 F. Supp. 421 (D. Ariz. 1988)

In RLM Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc., the court found found that custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement because the custom in the industry was that if you transfer a business you also transfer distribution rights. In RLM, the court found that absent any other facts, it was reasonable to believe that parties were following custom. Therefore, there was an agreement between RLM and Taylor. Here, the court will likely find [rule] because [legally relevant facts from exam].

- **Rule:** Contract assent can be express or implied. Agreements can be implied in whole or in part through conduct alone or through usage of trade. *See RST Contracts Section 4* An implied agreement concerning the issue of transferability may arise in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary if custom or practice in the industry provides for such an understanding.

- **Note:** The very fact that you are using the objective test means that there was no express intent - there was no explicit "I promise to sell you my car."

## Varieties

## Universal RP test

- Only relevant evidence is the specific words and content being interpreted. Words have set meaning. Positioned outside of the history and circumstances of the parties and apart from the context in which they were uttered or performed. Associated with a formalist approach to law and legal interpretation not generally followed today. If the court were using this test in Embry, it would only look at the words McKittrick said, not context. Embry's request is context. The context and timing led the court to find that there was a contract. Critique of universal reasonable person test: it favors the powerful party.

## Positioned RP test

- Interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a "universal" observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication. *This was used by the court in Embry.* Relevant evidence includes evidence of the history of the parties' relationship and of the circumstances surrounding the communications.

- Turn the facts into factors. If you take these facts and turn them into factors you can use in the next case, then you can use them.

## Factors for positioned RP test

- clarity of representation
- seriousness
- definiteness / level of detail
- context
- relationship of the parties
- prior dealings
- industry custom
- urgent need / time sensitivity?
- Etc.

What was said? And what would that lead a reasonable person to believe? Use factors.

**Charles R Embry v Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods Company** Missouri Court of Appeals 105 S.W. 777 (1907)

In McKittrick, the court found Embry did not satisfy the positioned reasonable person standard because it was reasonable for an employee in Embry's position to believe when he heard "go ahead, your are all right, get your men out, don't let that worry you," combined with surrounding circumstances such as the past interactions between employer and employee, that he was contracted by McKittrick for another year. Therefore, there was a contract between McKittrick and Embry. Here, the court will likely find [rule] because [legally relevant facts from exam].

- **Rule:** If the words or acts of two parties would be understood by a reasonable person to manifest the intention of both parties to enter into a contract, a contract is created, regardless of whether a party did not intend to enter into the contract so long as a reasonable person would find that the inner intention is not embodied in the words used by or acts of the parties. (62 4th para)

**United Steelworkers of America, Local 1330 v. U.S. Steel** USDC for the Northern District of Ohio, 492 F. Supp. 1 (1980)

In Local 1330 v. U.S. Steel, the court found that U.S. Steel's statements asking workers to help keep the company open did not represent a promise made by the corporation to not shut the steel mills down if profit increased. The workers alleged that the company had promised to keep the plants open as long as they remain profitable if the workers took wage concessions, which the workers took, thinking this would keep the steel mills open and save their jobs. The workers claimed that there was a promise based on various statements of the company executives. The question was whether the company's statement was an enforceable promise. Here the court took a very narrow focus and held that U.S. Steel's statement that "your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate" did not represent a promise made by the corporation on which the workers should have reasonably relied. The court reasoned that the statement made by U.S. Steel was not specific enough to constitute a unilateral contract accepted by workers through full performance of the actions the statement asked them to perform.

- Note: If you wanted to say yes there was a promise, you look at the relationships, how people had very little power. Make the case by putting yourself in the shoes of the workers, what they heard and how they world interrpret it.

**Death of a Salesman Hypo**

1. Willy doesn't want to travel any more. Asks Howard (son of the old owner) for an office job in town.
2. Suppose that Howard's father said to Willy, "i'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town."
3. Would a reasonable person in Willy's shoes think that a promise was made?

- **Willy** would argue that there was a promise because a reasonable person in Willy's shoes who heard the owner of his business say "I'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town..." would think a promise was made, based on the relationship of owner-employee, industry custom to promise future employment in this type of casual conversation, level of specificity (in town), etc. Therefore, there was an enforceable promise.
- **Loman** would argue that there was not a promise because a reasonable person in Willy's shoes who heard the owner of his business say "I'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town..." wouldn't think there was a promise of office employment in the future based on the conversation was years ago, not clear, definite or detailed, used the words "I'm sure." Therefore, there was not an enforceable promise. ("I'm sure" is often used colloquially to mean the exact opposite: I'm not sure. Use factors. Statement lacks clarity and definiteness (i.e. "a place"))
- Note: Think of the relationship of the parties. An employee and an employer. An employee asking a question of his employer.

**Bar/farm hypo**

- People drinking in a bar. One contracts to sell their farm to the other for $50,000. Farm was really worth a lot more. Next day seller refuses to sell saying they didn't really promise (just kidding). Enforceable promise? Yes. Here we don't have facts that say they were incapacitated because they were drunk, so we assume they had capacity.

## Socially situated RP analysis

Interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a "universal" observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication but who also has the social identity of the recipient. Draws from the UN CISG, which provides that statements and conduct of contracting parties should be interpreted according to the parties' own shared meanings, but if these cannot be ascertained, then the statements should be interpreted according to the understanding that "a reasonable person *of the same kind* (including nationality, culture, religion and the like) as the other party would have had in the same circumstances." Relevant evidence includes history and circumstances of the communication and also the practices of the parties' trades or communities and their own experiences in negotiations of this sort. Critics of the socially situated theory argue that it is better to challenge class and other bias in the objective theory than to invite judges to indulge in stereotypical versions of others' perspectives, which is very essentializing.

## Problems with RP standard

The critique of the reasonable person test, whichever way you look at it, is the problem of bias, of essentializing. Race. Gender. Class. The objective test is the test that courts use, because it's more rational than the subjective test. So we have to figure out how to use it in the least harmful way. The key is that either a reasonable person interpreted something in a way or *should have* interpreted it in that way.

## Using the objective test

Questions to ask: How did the court determine what a reasonable person would have thought? What facts did the court rely on? What facts support a counterargument that a reasonable person would have thought in a way?


## Subjective theory of interpretation

Under the "subjective theory" of interpretation the court would evaluate what both people actually thought (by indirect evidence) and the court would only find a contract if there had been a "meeting of the minds."  The subjective test allows for differences between people and aims to prevent contracts being formed by accident. The problem with the subjective theory of interpretation is that it is extremely difficult to determine what people actually thought. The subjective theory approach was taken by the trial court in Embry, where the jury was instructed that if they found that both parties expressed the intent to contract with the other party for the plaintiff’s employment for one year, they should find that the parties thereby entered into a contract. At appeal, the court questioned whether this jury instruction was a correct statement of law, asking whether the formation of a contract depended on the intention of the then plaintiff and the then defendant or on the words spoken by both parties. The higher court took the objective theory approach which resulted in a reversal of the lower court's ruling.

# III. Theories of Relief

## A. Bargain theory

The bargain theory is a theory of relief where a promise to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations. Under the bargain theory, an enforceable promise becomes a contract where there is assent (offer and acceptance) and reciprocity (consideration). Closely related to neo-classical economic theory, the bargain  values efficiency and profit-making and assumes that bargains are motivated by self-interest and that people act in their own self interest, rationally and with access to perfect information, that people and resources are freely movable and that there are no artificial restrictions to entry to the market.

Or

A bargain is an agreement to exchange promises or to exchange a promise for a performance or to exchange performances. Under the bargain theory of relief where a promise to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations, an enforceable promise becomes a contract where there is assent (offer and acceptance) and reciprocity (consideration).

# Contract Formation Elements

## Assent

Assent, or mutual assent, sometimes called the meeting of the minds of the parties, is the expressed willingness of each party to enter into an agreement. No contract is formed unless both parties assent. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts (“RST”) § 3 defines an agreement as a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons. For there to be assent, there must be an offer and an acceptance of that offer.

Note on the polarity of the offer-acceptance model: In § 2-204(b) of the UCC, Professor Karl Llewelyn sought to reform the "yes/no - was there a contract" polarity of contract formation in "(b) An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined." This allows courts to develop a flexible open-ended model of contract formation in contracts for the sale of goods.

## Offer and acceptance

Offer and Acceptance: both require assent. Two steps:

1. Did a party make an offer?   
2. Was there acceptance?  

Did there come a time in the communication between the parties when either party communicated a "willingness to enter into a bargain, so made to justify [a reasonable person in the position of the other party] in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it"? See RST § 24.

## Offer

Under RST § 24, an offer is a manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by an offeror to an offeree. This rule is interpreted by the courts the objective theory of interpretation, which provides that words and conduct of the parties should be interpreted as a reasonable person would interpret them, to determine whether the communications of the parties constitute an offer. No formalities, such as words of promise, are required; the offer may be written or spoken, communicated by other conduct, or implied by facts, and the offer can be made by the buyer or seller.

**Breakdown:** Under RST § 24, an offer is a "manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by offeror to offeree."

- No formalities are required.
- May be written or spoken or other conduct.
- May be implied by the facts.
- Offer can be made by the buyer or seller.

All that is required are words or conduct that would lead a reasonable person in the shoes of the party to believe a promise has been made.

Hypos: are these an offer? THE THREE HYPOS ARE IN SLIDES

**Rancher hypo:** 5/20 Rancher stops by to talk to his neighbor. Tells neighbor he's interested in selling his ranch and asks if neighbor is interested in buying. Neighbor says he's interested and he will see if he can find the money. Rancher says he'll determine the value of the property and get back to the neighbor. 6/13 neighbor calls the rancher to see if he was still selling. Rancher replies that he was still selling and that there's just a little delay. Says, "don't worry, everything is in order." 6/17 Rancher sends a letter to the neighbor and to three other neighbors asking if they'd be interested in buying the ranch. The letter details the price and all the terms. Did the rancher an offer to the neighbor? Did he make an offer to the other neighbors? No. This is an advertisement. Too many people. An advertisement that induces performance can be an offer.  

**Hypo:** I promise to give you $100 if you give me the apples. The whole thing is an offer.

**Hypo:** The Gap is putting an ad in the paper that they are selling a sweater (see slide class of 1-20-21)

**Hypo:** Will you sell me your property for $60,000? I said yes. Seems like no, it's not an offer because it's too vague and doesn't provide enough detail, and isn't a promise.

## Four factors

A court will weigh and balance a series of factors when considering whether there was a manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by an offeror to an offeree. These factors include language, including whether there were words of promise or commitment; the level of detail of the communication’s terms; the number of people the communication was addressed to, and whether the communication named a party or parties; trade usage and/or custom including relevant community practices; prior dealings and/or conversations between the parties; characterization including whether the communication was a price quote, advertisement, or other factors. One or more factors may have stronger weight than others depending on the context of the communication.

**Breakdown:** A court will weigh/balance factors when considering whether there was a manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by an offeror to an offeree. One or more factors may have stronger weight than others depending on the context of the communication.

1. **Language - words of promise or commitment?** Did the words of the communication indicate a willingness, at that moment, to make a committment? If so, the communication appears more like an offer.
2. **Level of detail** Did the communication include detailed terms? If so, the communication appears more like an offer.
3. **Number of people (and does it name a party or parties?** To how many people was the communication directed? If to one person, the communication appears more like an offer.
4. **Trade usage/custom** Are there any relevant community practices ("trade practices")
5. **Prior Dealings/prior conversations** Are there past conversations between the parties, past contracts between the parties ("course of dealings"), or other circumstances that would inform a reasonable person's interpretation of the communication? If so, these may make the communication appear to be more or less like an offer.
6. **Characterization (price quotation, ad...)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Generaliizations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">1. Generally, advertisements should not be characterized as offers because they are addressed to a large number of people.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">2. Generally, price quotes, catalogues and price lists should not be characterized as offers because they are phrased in general terms, not focused on a specific order or job, and are addressed to many people.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">3. Generally, putting a price tag on an item and putting it on a shelf in a store should not be characterized as an offer because sellers can change a price tag or remove the item without notifying buyers.</p>

**Hypos:**

- Will you sell me your property for $60,000?
- It would not be possible for me to sell it unless I would receive $70,000 cash.
- Do you want to buy 240 good 1000 lb cattle for $1000?

**Offer Factors:** these are some of the factors we would use to see if there was an offer in the rancher test. It's similar to the factors in the objective test. This list is a bit particular to offers.

- **Language** – words of promise or commitment? For there to be an offer there doesn't have to be words of promise; but if there are that makes it more likely that there is an offer.
- **Level of detail:** in Rancher hypo not much detail in first convo, but in letter a lot more, and the more detail the more like an offer.
- **Number of people to whom addressed (and does it name a party or parties?):** in Rancher four people; that's not infinite, very finite, but still more thhan hhe could accommodate. Also did Rancher name people? Yes, neighbors, so more liikeley offer
- **Trade usage / custom:**  
- **Prior dealings / prior conversations:** for example we have been dealing with each other and month to month contract but every month we renew so we understand there's an expectation to renew
- **Characterization (price quotation, ad…):** if its an ad, it's usually not an offer; if it's a reward, it usually is an offer.

**Additional Factors Consideredin Pepsico:**

- **Price:** the court says that the price is very low because -the jet is worth about 23 million dollars. If the price is extremely disproportionate to the actual value, the less likely it is to be an offer.
- **Ability to follow through:** fighter jet not for regular consumption; Pepsico not likely to be able to follow through with delivering a Harrier jet to a sixteen-year old.
- **Level of seriousness:** a reasonable person would understand that it's a joke.
- **Characterization of the proposal:** What does the court say about Ads?

## Yes offers

**The following are *usually* considered offers:**

- Offer of Rewards
- Prove me wrong offers
- Prizes for skill and luck

Factors here:

- Limits the number of people who can accept
- Induces action

## No not offers

- Advertisements
- price quotes, catalogues, price lists
- putting price tag on an item and placing it on a shelf in a store

## Advertisement

Generally, an advertisement is not an offer because it is usually addressed to a large number of people and phrased in general terms. Instead, there is a presumption that an ad is a solicitation of an offer, or a mere request to consider and examine and negotiate unless the circumstances are exceptional, and the words used are very plain and clear. *Leonard v. Pepsico*, 88 F.Supp. 2d 116 (1999). For an advertisement to be an offer, there must be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without further communication. An ad is more likely to be considered an offer if it (1) limits the number of people who can accept; (2) invites performance; and (3) communicates willingness to commit.

**Breakdown:** SEE SLIDE FROM CLASS WITH SUB-RULES!!!

**Presumption:**  Solicitation of offer / invitation to negotiate. Even if it has all the detail in it, it's still presumed to be a solicitation of an offer rather than an offer, *because it goes to a lot of people* - it doesn't matter how detailed it is. It's not an offer unless it fits into one of the exceptions.

**Exceptions**

1. Limits number of people who can accept, e.g., "first come first served"; "while supplies last"
2. Invites performance, e.g. offer for a reward, prove me wrong, or prizes for skill and luck (I've only got one cat so I've limited the number of people, and I've induced performance); they're not worried about the number of people who will... *Carbolic Smoke Ball*
3. Communicates willingness to commit

---

**Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.** (discussed in Pepsi)

- In *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.*, the court found that an ad was an offer because it invited performance by stating that the company would give £100 to anyone who used the product and still got the flu, the advertiser invited performance by calling on the public to prove it wrong and communicated a willingness to commit by promising a reward if they did.
- Rule/Law: Advertisements offering rewards are offers to anyone who does perform the conditions named in the advertisement, and anybody who does perform the condition accepts the offer. RST § 24 (I think).

**John D.R. Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.** U.S. District Court, SDNY (1999)  

- In Pepsico, the court found that a TV ad displaying a person redeeming Pepsi points in exchange for a Harrier jet was not an offer because it did not have clear, definite and explicit terms and because the details of the offer were reserved by Pepsico to a separate writing in its catalogue.

- In Pepsico, the court found that a TV ad displaying a person redeeming Pepsi points in exchange for a Harrier jet was not an offer because a reasonable person in appellant Leonard's position would have understood that the commercial stating that the Harrrier jet could be purchased with 7,000,000 Pepsi Stuff points was a joke.  

- **Rule/Law:** For an advertisement to be an offer, there must be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without further communication (could this invitation to take action be an order form?). (99) Advertisements are mere requests to consider and examine and negotiate unless the circumstances are exceptional and the words used are very plain and clear. (99) An advertisement is not transformed into an enforceable offer merely by a potential offeree's expression of willingness to accept the offer through, among other means, completion of an order form. (99) Advertisements and the completion of order forms are mere notices and solicitations for offers. (99) Purchase orders are not enforceable contracts until they are accepted by the seller (99-100). RST § 26 states that "[a] manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has madde a further manifestation of assent" (100).

Arguments that Pepsico was not an offer: It was just an advertisement; this was an ad on TV; TV ads are exactly the kind of ad that are generally not considered an offer.

Counterarguments: You can make the case that Pepsico seeks to induce performance, and that performance is to collect Pepsico points. On the one hand you could say that it's inducing performance, because you keep buying Pepsis. The court did not agree, and said that pepsi was not inducing promise, but inducing a counter promise.

- If just an ad, what about the rest of the items in the commercial (leather jacket, sun glasses, etc.)? Answer: if it's just an ad, and there are no exceptions, there's no issue with the leather jacket or the sunglasses; this is not an offer.

Arguments that Pepsico is NOT an offer:

- Characterization: Not that definite
- Trade usage: not in the catalog
- Level of seriousness: just a joke   
- Price:  Too good to be true

Arguments that Pepsico WAS an offer:

- Same level of commitment / definiteness as other items in the commercial
- Price: maybe reasonable person not aware of price discrepancy or that it is a fighter jet  
- Trade usage:

Apply socially situated RP test - court says ad is targeting younger generation - the Pepsi generation - you might say that a reasonable teenager doesn't know that it is a fighter jet.

*Based on the court’s holding, use the facts that the Pepsico court consider important in determining whether an offer had been made to construct a rule that future courts can use to determine whether there was an offer.*  

**Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus** (discussed in Pepsi)

# Acceptance

Acceptance of an offer is defined in RST § 50 as a manifestation of assent to the terms of the offer, made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer. This rule is interpreted by the courts using the objective theory of interpretation, defined above. To determine whether there was acceptance, courts usually apply the positioned reasonable person test which interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a “universal” observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication. Relevant evidence includes evidence of the history of the parties’ relationship and of the circumstances surrounding the communications and takes into account the mode and manner of acceptance, if any, specified in the offer.

Generally, an offer may specify any mode or manner of acceptance that the offeror desires. However, if the offeror does not specify that a specific manner of acceptance is the only accepted manner, a court will interpret the offer to allow acceptance in any reasonable manner. The mode and manner of acceptance also depends on whether an offer is bilateral or unilateral. In bilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for a promise, acceptance happens with the return promise, and both parties are bound when the return promise is made. Bilateral contracts follow the mirror image rule where acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer and even small, unimportant change will result in no acceptance, becoming instead a counteroffer. In unilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for performance, acceptance occurs when the offeree renders full performance, and neither party is bound unless and until the offeree has performed. Because courts generally favor bilateral offers, a unilateral offer must specify that it can be accepted only by performance, otherwise it will be deemed bilateral by a court. If the offer specifies that it can only be accepted by full performance, the contract is not formed until the offeree has performed everything specified in the offer. After this is done, only the offeror needs to perform because the offeree has fully performed.

## Mirror image rule

Under the mirror image rule, acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer. Even small, unimportant change will result in no acceptance, but instead become a counteroffer.

**Hypo:** If I say I'll sell you my house for $5000, and you say yes I'll buy it as long as you vacate it on Tuesday. You've modified the terms. You created new obligations without my assent. So when you change the terms you're making a counteroffer. Your acceptancce is not a mirror image of the offer.

**Hypo:** If I say I'll sell you my house for $5000, but to be vacated Thursday. If you say "ok great I'll buy your house but can you vacate on Wednesday?", you still have an offer because you aren't changing the terms. If, however, you said "yes great I'll buy your house but only if you vacate on Wednesday " here, you no longer have an offer because you have changed the terms.

You turn my offer into a counteroffer, you become the new offeror. I become the new offeree.

## Counteroffer

- offer made by offeree to offeror
- Relating to same matter as original offer
- proposing substitute bargain
- No K until the counteroffer accepted

Sub-rules from this case (Panhandle?) (see slides for rule):

- Acceptance is still effective if the "addition" only asks for something that was implied in the offer anyway. *Panhandle*
- still an acceptance if "mere request"
- still an acceptance if offeree expresses dissatisfaction with the offer but still manifests intent to accept ("grumbling acceptance")

---

**Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Nowlin Smith, Jr.** Wyoming Supreme Court 637 P.2d 1020 (1981) *Panhandle also in manner or mode of acceptance!*

In Panhandle v. Smith, the court found that Smith accepted Panhandle's offer to withdraw Smith's discharge even though Smith added words to the letter of discharge because the notes that Smith wrote on the letter were "grumbling" and were not a modification of the offer. The court found that the term added by Smith that he be able to view his personnel file were implicit in the offer because by CBA all employees had a right to view their personnel file. Therefore, this condition was not a new term that modified the contract and was thus not a counteroffer.

- **Rule/Law:** (2) An acceptance is still effective if the addition only asks for something that would be implied from the offer and is therefore immaterial. (p. 109)

---

## Mode or manner of Acceptance

**General rule:** An offer may specify any manner of acceptance that the offeror desires. (p. 109) If the offeror does not specify that a specific manner of acceptance is the only accepted manner, a court will interpret the offer to allow acceptance in any reasonable manner.

**Breakdown:** Rules for mode of acceptance

- Offeror is master of the offer
- Offeror can demand an exclusive mode of acceptance
- Must be clear/expressly stated that exclusive mode of acceptance (must be clear that the only way offeree can accept the offer - court is not going to be eager because courts favor contracts in general)
- Otherwise, court will interpret offer as allowing acceptance in any reasonable manner
- Example: contract said if you want to accept reply by return mail. If person hand delivers reply, arguably it is a valid mode of acceptance, because the mode of acceptance is specific but reply by return mail does not say *only* reply by return mail.

**UCC Article 2-206** provides "Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances ... an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances." (p. 110) (UCC Art. 2 applies to the sale of goods [anything movable], not to sale of real estate or sale of services; UCC is a realist code - more flexible/liberal approach to contract formation). Art 2 was drafted by legal realists in the 1950s; trying to reflect reality rather than something rigid. It was written to cover buying and selling goods in the marketplace; the goal is to promote the free flow of ccontracts in the marketplacce; so important for jobs and stuff that goods be freely changing hands - so legal realists decided to come up with a set of rules that would reflect human experience. In a one-on-one situation the mirror image rule makes sense, but in the marketplace businesses have forms which they use over and over.

**Widget hypo:** Typical scenario: you have a merchant who sells widgets. They get a lawyer who drafts their purchase form. Buyers have lawyers who draft their purchase orders. Sellers might have terms saying that they disclaim all warranties; buyers might have a term that says valid in all state of PA. Buyer says i want to buy 500 widgets. Seller says ok great i'll sell you 500 widgets. what they're buying and selling is what they want to buy and sell and is the same, but their forms will be different, so the mirror image rule doesn't make sense in this kind of situation. Therefore,

1. the sale of good under UCCC art. 2, the mirror rule does not apply.
2. you can have a contract even if the acceptance has terms different from the offer, as long as the "bargained for" terms agree (you can have different language in the boilerplate)
- terms are: everything the parties have agreed to + whatever the code fills into the gap as the rule (the code is the UCC)

Note: UCC acceptance rule is identical to the common law. The only time we need to know is when the mirror image rule does not apply (when between merchants)

**Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Nowlin Smith, Jr.** Wyoming Supreme Court 637 P.2d 1020 (1981) *Panhandle also in counteroffer!*

In Panhandle v. Smith, the court found that Smith accepted Panhandle's offer to withdraw Smith's discharge even though Smith added words to Pandandle's letter of discharge because Panhandle did not specify that the mode of acceptance of its offer excluded all other modes of acceptance including writing any words on the letter of discharge. The court found that the requirement that Smith not write on the letter is unreasonable because the only reason the court surmised that Panhandle could have for stipulating that Smith not write on the letter was "an inordinate fondness for tidy sheets of paper." Unreasonable requirements must be specified in the communicated offer.

- **Rule/Law:** (1) An offeror has the right to accept an exclusive mode of acceptance from an offeree. An exclusive mode of acceptance can be unreasonable or difficult if it clearly excludes all other modes of acceptance, and this intention is expressed in the communicated offer itself.

## Bilateral v uniletaral contracts

*The only difference between these theories is in acceptance (this is why it goes under acceptance in the outline)*

Generally, an offer may specify any mode or manner of acceptance that the offeror desires. However, if the offeror does not specify that a specific manner of acceptance is the only accepted manner, a court will interpret the offer to allow acceptance in any reasonable manner. The mode and manner of acceptance also depends on whether an offer is bilateral or unilateral. In bilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for a promise, acceptance happens with the return promise, and both parties are bound when the return promise is made. Bilateral contracts follow the mirror image rule where acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer and even small, unimportant change will result in no acceptance, becoming instead a counteroffer. In unilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for performance, acceptance occurs when the offeree renders full performance, and neither party is bound unless and until the offeree has performed. Because courts generally favor bilateral offers, a unilateral offer must specify that it can be accepted only by performance, otherwise it will be deemed bilateral by a court. If the offer specifies that it can only be accepted by full performance, the contract is not formed until the offeree has performed everything specified in the offer. After this is done, only the offeror needs to perform because the offeree has fully performed. A unilateral offer will implicitly require full performance if it requests the offeree do something dangerous, risky, or unlikely to occur.

**Breakdown:**

Bilateral:

- promise in exchange for promise
- acceptance happens with return promise
- both parties bound when the return promise is made

Unilateral:

- promise in exchange for performance
- acceptance occurs when offeree renders full performance
- no one is bound unless/until offeree performs
- offer must specify that it can be accepted only by performance

**Bilateral vs. unilateral hypos:**

(I) I promise to pay you $30 if you deliver these apples. "Ok." bilateral or unilateral?

- Answer: bilateral because not clear that it is unilateral. Every contract is conditional on someone doing something. Most contracts are bilateral. Just using the word "if" does not make it unilateral. "ok" makes it sound like a promise - makes it sound bilateral. two ways to interpret: one is that "ok" is a promise. Other way is i'll pay you if and only if you deliver these apples. If he had said "I'll pay you when the apples are delivered" it would be unilateral. Would would a reasonable person think? **MAJOR GUIDELINE: STRONG PREFERENCE FOR BILATERAL AND STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT THE PARTIES WANTED IT TO BE BILATERAL.** Presumption is that a reasonable person would think it were bilateral.

(2) Frank: "I promise to pay you $100 if you paint my fence." Barb: "ok."

- Really the same thing as (I). It's unclear. You can make arguments on both sides. But the best answer would take into account the strong preference for bilateral contracts.

(3) Frank: "I promise to pay you $100 if you find and return my lost cat." Barb: "ok."

- This is the same as (1) and (2) except that it's not. Would a reasonable person be promising to find the cat? The presumption shifts when the offer is for a reward. Finding the cat is unlikely. Not guaranteed. A reasonable person would probably think that she is not promising to find the cat.

**Typical examples of unilateral contracts**

- offer of a reward
- contest
- standard insurance contract
- at will employment
- Rule: an offer will implicitly require full performance if it requests the offeree do something dangerous, risky, or unlikely to occur.

What are the implications of characterizing something as unilateral rather than bilateral? How do you know which is called for?

- K interpretation
- Look at parties' intent
- Objective test
- Court preference for bilateral

**Acceptance by promise (express or implied): bilateral contracts:** Usually, an acceptance will take the form of an express or implied promise (someone can accept an offer by making a promise). Promise to purchase in response to listing of sale (Southworth v. Oliver, p. 110); hand shake; handing of keys of motorbike to offeror of purchase. If an offer permits an acceptance by promise, then both parties are bound by the contract as soon as the return promise is made ("cross promises"). There are two promises. Hence bilateral. (p. 111)

**Acceptance by full performance: unilateral contracts:**  If the offer specifies that it can only be accepted by full performance, the contract is not formed until the offeree has performed everything specified in the offer. After this is done, only the offeror needs to perform because the offeree has fully performed. Because only one party is obligated, this is a unilateral contract. (p. 111) In the past unilateral contracts were limited to rewards ("$500 if you find my dog") and contests ("$20 if you score five basketss in five minutes"). Now, many contracts are unilateral; for example, an insurance contract where insurance company promises to pay if insuree pays premium. An at-will employment contract is unilateral; courts have found that the employer makes a new offer each day and the employee accepts the offer by going to work each day. (p. 112)

1. When an offer may be accepted by any reasonable means an offeree may accept by full performance or by promise. **RST § 32:** In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.
2. Sometimes an offer will expressly require acceptance by promise or accceptance by full performance as an exclusive mode of acceptancce.
3. If the offer requests that the offeree do something dangerous, risky or unlikely to occur, the offer will implicitly require full performance. (p. 111)

---

## Acceptance by silence

The general rule is that silence cannot be acceptance. There are three exceptions:

1. when the parties explicitly agree that silence will constitute acceptance (e.g. "if you don't hear from me by Friday you can assume the offer is accepted by us");
2. when the parties' past dealings have established a practice in which silence conveys acceptance (i.e. when the parties have impliicitly agreed that silence will be accceptance); and
3. when the offeree has already received the benefits of the offered contract.

**Theodore B. Russell v. Texas Co.** U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, 238 F.2d 636 (1956)

- **Issue:** Whether an offeree may vitiate a contract by a claim of lack of intention to accept an offer when he accepts and retains the benefits offered to him by the offeror, with a positive and affirmative proviso by the offeror that such acceptance of the benefits will, in and of itself, be deemed by the offeror to be an acceptance. (p. 115)
- **Narrow Issue:** Whether Texas Co. accepted Russel's offer of a revocable license for use of real property section 23.
- **Facts:**
- **I. Uncontested facts:** Russell's predecessors acquired section 23 from the Northern Pacific Railway Company through a contract in 1918. In the contract and deed were miniral rights. The Texas Co. conducted operations in section 23 since 1952 under an oil and gas lease granted by Norrthern Pacific Railway Company. The Texas Co. has also made use of the surface of section 23.   
- **II. Appellant Russel’s factual allegations:** Russel argued that its offer of a license to Texas Co. stated that the continued use of section 23 constituted acceptance.  
- **III. Respondent Texas Co.’s factual allegations:** Texas Co. argued that it never accepted Russel's offer of a revocable license for the use of section 23 because Texas Co. did not intend to accept this offer.
- **IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:**
- **Procedural History:** Russell sued Texas Co. for nonpayment in trial court. The trial court found that Texas Co. had accepted Russel's offer of a revocable contract and ruled that Texas Co. should therefore pay Russell damages. Texas Co. appealed.  
- **Court’s Reasoning:** See application below.
- **Rule/Law:** Under RST § 72.2 "Where the offeree exercises dominion over things which are offered to him, such exercise of dominion in the absence of other circumstances showing a contrary intention is an acceptance, though the offeree manifests an intention not to accept.""
- **Application:** The court applied the reasonable person test which asks whether or not the offeror was led to reasonably believe that the act of the offeree was an acceptance; the court found that in this case, it was. (p. 116)
- **Policy:**
- **Holding:** An offeree may vitiate a contract by a claim of lack of intention to accept an offer when he accepts and retains the benefits offered to him by the offeror, with a positive and affirmative proviso by the offeror that such acceptance of the benefits will, in and of itself, be deemed by the offeror to be an acceptance.
- **Disposition:** Judgement affirmed as to appelants.
- **Context (why the case was assigned):** To illustrate acceptance by silence.

## End User License Agreements (EULAs)

**Click wrap:** Applies to internet transactions.  

- User must click on box saying “I agree.”

**Browse wrap:** Like click wrap but you don’t have to click “I agree.” Website provides notice of the terms and conditions.

- User must have actual or constructive knowledge of the website’s terms and conditions
- Depends on design and content of the website
- Court looks for textual notice on every page -- user has to go past to get to site
- Notice must be conspicuous and well-placed
- PLUS language directing user to terms “Read our terms before signing..”

**Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc.** U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit 763 F.3d 1171 (2014)

In Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc., the court found that the mere presence of a link without some obvious prompt to take affirmative action was not sufficient to bind a user to an arbitration agreement described in the terms and conditions. Using basic offer and acceptance terms, the court found that there must be a mutual manifestation of intent and the user must have actual or constructive knowledge of the websites' terms and conditions. The onus is on the website owner to provide the user with actual or constructive knowledge that by visiting the website the user agrees to the terms and conditions hyperlinked to the website. In this case you can see the court's disfavor of browse wrap contracts. The Court is requiring very specific placement of information.

**Shrink wrap:**  Applies to store bought software (or over the phone).  

- Reference to license agreements is placed on the outside of the software packaging.

**Shrink wrap hypo:** Consumer orders computer software from Gateway; software arrives including list of terms; says these terms will apply if the customer uses the software or fails to return it after 30 days; customer keeps the software for more than 30 days; later has a complaint about the software; one term says mandatory arbitration; consumer wants to sue in court.

- **Issue:** Are these additional terms part of the contract? (is he limited to arbitration?) Customer says he didn't agree to arbitration because he didn't have access to those terms when he bought the software. Using traditional offer and acceptance analysis the customer would say terms occurred when customer bought software from Gateway over the phone. That was the contract.  
- **Did a party make an offer?** Gateway made an offer when they said what they were selling, the customer said they'd purchase it, and Gateway said they'd send it. Customer calls in and gateway makes the offer by saying we promise to sell you the software for x amount of money - the mode of acceptance is exclusive - basically by using the goods/exercising dominion over the goods - or by silence over 30 days. The way courts interpret this is that the only way to accept is to use the software or be silent for 30 days (the way these shrink wrap agreements work is there is a conspicuous notice on the outside of the software that says that the terms are inside the package).
- **Policy:** Gateway would argue that in terms of policy this is reasonable because if these 30 days did not constitute acceptance we would be in a perpetual state of uncertainty as to whether the products were sold; this is what is necessary for markets to function. Gateway would argue that providing terms and conditions over the phone is not good policy because nobody is going to wait on the phone while Gateway reads the contract. Thirty days contracts tend to be waivers of warranty, limitation of liability, mandatory arbitration. These type of shrink wrap contracts might not be enforceable if our societies decided that they were not wanted. Courts make an argument with thirty day acceptance based on policy.

## Revocation prior to acceptance

There are Four ways to terminate an offer. These are:

1. Rejection - only the offeree can reject - would a reasonable person in the offeree's situation ...
2. Revocation - the offeror can revoke the offer
3. Lapse - the offer can lapse. I made offer you said nothing; it's no longer reasonable to understand the offer is still open. What is a reasonable period of time? If oral offer, the offer lapses as soon as the conversation is over. If written, it is a reasonable period of time; if it's a big thing it can take longer
4. Death or incapacity of either party - an offer is not transferable; if the person who made the offer passes away, the offer is over.

Revocation is the tricky one. Starting rule: the offeror can revoke at any time prior to acceptance.

**Dickinson v. Dodds**

- **Facts:**
- 6/10:  Offer
- 6/11 (morning): Dickinson decides to accept
- 6/11 (afternoon):  Dodds sells property to Allen
- Later Dickinson was informed that Dodds sold property to Allen
- 6/11 (evening): Dickinson leaves formal acceptance letter with Dodds’ mother-in-law
- 6/12 (morning):  Dodds receives Dickinson’s acceptance
- Dodds made a valid revocation (he actually got lucky).
- **Rule:** The offeror can revoke at any time before acceptance even if the offeror promises not to revoke. However, the offeror cannot revoke after acceptance. (Contract law doesn't value promises. Contract law only values promises that are an exchange, which makes them a contract.) For an offer to be revoked, the offeree must get actual notice of the revocation, and the notice must be reliable information, but the notice of revocation does not have to come directly from thhe offeror.
- **Policy:** No one is bound until there is mutuality. Also, at the core of contract law is the exchange of goods valued by the Neoclassical economic theory.

Revocation made to the public by an ad: 1. the fine print; 2.

Hypo

How can offeror revoke an offer made by a newspaper ad, poster, or other general notification to the public?

Post a new advertisement. If II make an offer through an advertisement to revoke the offer i would want to put it out in the same publication to reacch roughly the same auddiencce. Even though I ccant giive actual notiicce to every person iif I make a good attempt aandd put the advertisement in the same publication.

BUT I don't have to use the same mode or medium to revoke an offer. It's only if it goes to the general public.

REVOCATION

Offeror can revoke any time prior to acceptance EVEN IF she promised not to revoke  UNLESS:

- Option K:  Additional consideration (exchange) plus signed writing  (§§ 25, 87(1))
- Or
- Firm Offer (UCC § 2-205):  Doesn’t require additional consideration if:
- Signed writing
- By a merchant

Then: Irrevocable during the time stated OR reasonable time BUT not longer than 3 months.

(UCCC is a legal realiist code written by legal realist iin the 1950s trying to make the code reflect real human experience)

WE'VE SEEN TWO THINGS WITH UCCC:

UCC RULE DOES NOT FOLLOW MIRROR IMAGE RULE
UNDER UCCC, IF THE SELLER PUTS IT IN WRITING AND THE SELLER IS A MERCHANT AND WRITES DOWN I PROMISE TO KEEP OFFER OPEN UNTIL JUNE 12TH THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO MAKE THE OFFER IRREVOCABLE. THE COMMON LAW DOESN'T HAVE THIS RULE.

We're only talking about offer and acceptance right now. For it to be a binding contract, you also need consideration.

You don't have a contract until you have the third element, which is consideration.

Two additional ways an offer ccan become irrevoccable is in the Drennan case. This is the third way an offer ccan become irrevocable:

**Drennan v. Star Paving Co.**

D made an offer
P used it to submit its bid
D revoked before P could say “I accept”
Valid revocation?

If the D had the right to revoke and they revoked properly, the revocation occurred before the plaintiff accepted. If the D didn't have the right to revoke or didn't revoke properly then there was no revocation.

Here, there was no revocation because the plaintiff relied on the defendant

From Drennan, if the offeree reasonably relies on the offer to theiir detriment, then the offer becomes irrevocable.

Here, the general contractor had to rely on the subcocntractor's offer to include it in their offer to the schcool. So iif the subconracctor were able to revoke their offer at this late date, then the general cocntracctor would be harmed. they reliied on it and their reliance was reasonable.

The plaintifff is a general contractor preparing to make a bid for a school contract. but thhey need to subcontract. they soliciit a subccontractor. the plaintiff willl accept the lowest bid from a subccontracctor and inccorporate that into theiir bid to the school. lowest bid was $7000 and they submit it. General contractor gets the job. Go back to tell the subcontractor I accept your bid. But before they can saay I accept, the defendant (the subccontracctor) revokes. Why didn't the general contractor accept right away? because they were waiting to see if they got the main job they were putting a bid in for.

How would the analysis be different if the bid were substantially lower than all the other bids? It would not be reasonable. If they had left a 0 out or something it wouldn't be a reasonable bid.

How is reliance on an offer that’s part of an exchange different from reliance on a promise to give a gift?

In most cases, it's not reasonable to rely on an offer. It's not reasonable to rely on an offer. It's very rare for a court to find that reliance on an offer is reasonable. Drennan case is reasonable reliance making the offer irrevocable.

Subrule is that usually, it's not reasonable to rely on an offer and usually the only time a court will find reliancce reasonable is when a contractor's bid reliies on the bid of a subcontractor. Drennan.  

**Revocaation rules:**

Offeror can revoke any time prior to acceptance EVEN IF she promised not to revoke  UNLESS:

Option K:  Additional consideration (exchange) plus signed writing (§ 87(1))

Firm Offer (UCC § 2-205):  Doesn’t require additional consideration.  Just signed writing by merchant…

Reasonable Reliance (Drennan) (§ 87(2))

Part Performance of Unilateral K (§ 45)

FOURTH WAY A CONTRACT BECOMES IRREVOCABLE:

Part performance of a unilateral K

Offer becomes irrevocable.
Part perf does not amount to acceptance.
Acceptance does not occur until full performance.
But offeror has to give offeree reasonable amount of time to complete performance.
What constitutes part performance?

I'll pay you $100 if you paint my fence. Part performance does not amount to acceptance.

Subrules:

What constitutes part performance?  

Usually:
Beginning of performance is required, not just mere preparation
But doesn’t need to be substantial performance – can be just the very start of performance

Once you have painted at least one slat, then you have tried to accept and I have to give you time to fully acccept with full performance.

Hypos

After losing my valuable watch at school I offer a reward to anyone who finds it and returns it.  Some students begin looking around the classroom. Can I revoke?

Yeah. Courts would say that findiing the watch doesn't require a lot of effort so looking iisnt beginning performeance. maybe delivering the watch wouldd be part performance.

naah see rule

I invite someone from California to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge for a reward.  They fly here but haven’t gotten to the bridge yet.  Can I revoke?

What constitutes part performance?

Usually:
Beginning of performance is required, not just mere preparation
But doesn’t need to be substantial performance – can be just the very start of performance

# Consideration

The doctrine of consideration requires that the exchange of promises between parties be based on notions of fairness, reliance, and efficiency. For a contract to be enforceable, in addition to their being assent (offer and acceptance), there must be consideration. For a court to find that there was consideration in promises exchanged, each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and must be given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. A fundamental principle in contract law, coming from Neo-classical economic theory, is that courts do not like to intervene in the adequacy of the deal and assume that both parties are acting rationally, freely and reasonably, and that they agree on the price.

Courts do not examine adequacy of consideration. However, nominal consideration (false or sham motive) is not good consideration. While consideration must be sufficient (there must be a bargained-for exchange of promises), courts do not look at adequacy. Instead, courts assume that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests, and further assumes that the court’s assumption that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests encourages the free flow of commerce. The bargain theory thus permits sellers to charge what the market will "bear" even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites, assuming that if individuals from these groups agree to pay more for goods this is because they want to pay that much, not because they need the goods. To determine whether there was consideration, courts perform a two-step analysis using the paradigms of legal detriment and bargained-for.

**RULE:** Both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

Note: Consideration is the standard analysis for both common law and UCC.

History: In the 16th century contracts were enforced when the court could find any motive for entering into a contract. Every time there was an understandable motive for entering into the contract, the contract should be enforced. In the late 1800s and early 1900s consideration doctrine shifted to look for the inducement. Courts were looking at the benefits and detriments of the contract for the parties. In the benefit-detriment test, both parties have to receive a benefit and incur a detriment. Now it has shifted back to motive, but to the very specific motive of getting the return promise. For example, if I sell you a car for money, my motive (or my consideration) has to be getting the money. Your motive has to be getting the car.

**Breakdown:**

- Each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- Given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- Legal Detriment

(two-step analysis: 1st party has to be making their promise so as to get the return promise; 2nd party has to be making their promise so as to get the return promise)

## Consideration steps of analysis

Two elements:

1. Legal detriment (IRAC)
2. Bargained-for (IRAC)

NOW WE ARE CALLING OFFEROR AND OFFEREE PROMISSOR AND PROMISSEE!

---

### 1. Legal Detriment

I: The first sub-issue is whether there was legal detriment.

R: For there to be legal detriment, both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

Sub-Rule 1: Legal detriment can take several forms [only write the sub-rule I am going to apply]:

- A promise to do something you have a legal right not to do.
- Presently doing something you have a legal right not to do [this would be in a unilateral contract situation - make sure analyzed unilateral in acceptance].
- Promising to forbear from doing something you have a legal right to do.
- Forbearing from something you have a legal right to do.
- Abandoning a legal right
- Limiting freedom of action in future (e.g., renouncing the right to sue, entering into covenants)
- Promise to a third party is included

Sub-rule 2: Both parties must incur a legal detriment.[Analyze legal detriment from both sides!!!!!]

**Landmark case for legal detriment:** *Hamer v. Sidway*   

*Hamer v. Sidway* is no longer good law in part 2 because they use the benefit-detriment test (now we use the bargained-for test), but it is excellent law in part 1 (legal detriment).

In *Hamer v. Sidway,* there was legal detriment to Nephew because he promised not to drink or smoke until he turned 21, which Nephew had a legal right to do. [facts make this a promise to forbear from sub-rule 1] In *Hamer v. Sidway,* there was legal detriment to Uncle because he promised to give Nephew $5,000 if he not drink or smoke until age 21, which Uncle had a legal right not to do. In this analysis, both parties are promisors and promisees.

**U.S. v. Betty Jo Meadors** 	

### 2. Bargained-For

I can think of bargained-for as having two very small IRACs

RST Section 71

Must be bargained for:

- sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- both parties must be making their promise so as to get the return promise

1. Party A has to be making their promise so as to get Party B's return promise.
2. Party B also has to be making their promise so as to get Party A's return promise.  

1. [Party A] made/didn't make their promise [to do something] so as to get [Party B's] return promise of [doing something].
2. [Party B] made/didn't make their promise [to do something] so as to get [Party A's] return promise of [doing something].

**Or, if unilateral:**

1. [Party A] made/didn't make their promise [to do something or to do their performance] so as to get [Party B's] return promise of [doing something or performance of something] [because [facts]].
2. [Party B] made/didn't make their promise [to do something or to do their performance] so as to get [Party A's] return promise of [doing something or performance of something] [because [facts]].

If consideration fails the contract is not enforceable.

**Example hypo from skills**

Laura didn't paint the painting so as to get Prof Z's return promise of $500 because Laura gave Prof. Z the painting before Prof. Z. promised to give Laura $500.

Prof. Z didn't promise the give $500 to Laura so as to get Laura's return promise of painting the painting because Laura had already painted the painting before Prof Z. promised to give Laura $500.

SUB-RULE 1: Courts do not examine **adequacy** of consideration. However, **nominal** consideration is not good consideration. While consideration must be **sufficient**, courts do not look at adequacy.

SUB-RULE 1, LONGER AND MORE COMPLETE: Courts do not examine **adequacy** of consideration. However, **nominal** consideration is not good consideration. While consideration must be **sufficient**, courts do not look at adequacy because their policy is based on neo-classical economic theory, which assumes that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests, and further assumes that the assumption that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests encourages the free flow of commerce. The bargain theory thus permits sellers to charge what the market will "bear" even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites, assuming that if individuals from these groups agree to pay more for goods this is because they want to, not because they have limited choice and need the goods.  

- Adequate (gross inadequacy however is potentially a way in which the courts might invalidate a contract)
- Nominal (a pretext; a lie)
- Sufficient (means that it's bargained for; that both parties are doing the action - making the promises - to get the other thing)

Things that will potentially destroy consideration:

- Mixed motive
- Past consideration
- Gift
- Nominal
- Pre-existing duty rule (police officer returning a person who was whatever)
- Illusory promises

Legal detriment can take several forms. Legal detriment is not satisfied where there is a **pre-existing duty.** A promise to do something one is already obligated to do is not valid consideration because there is no legal detriment because the promisor does not have a legal right not to do it. Pre-existing duty can arise from law. In *Angela White v. Homewood,* the town not promising to administer the physical fitness test did not satisfy legal detriment because the town did not have a legal right not to administer the test. White’s alleged consideration was to take the test; she promised to sign an exculpatory agreement so that she could take the test. The Village promised to allow her to take the test but already had a legal obligation to allow her to take the test, so there is no legal detriment. Therefore, White’s signing of the exculpatory agreement was a gift, and legal detriment fails. Bargained-for also fails, because maybe the town was partly motivated by getting White to sign the agreement, but this doesn’t matter because legal detriment failed. Legal detriment always fails in pre-existing duty.

Legal detriment can take several forms. Legal detriment is not satisfied where there is an **illusory promise**, by which performance is entirely optional. An illusory promise is a promise in form but not in substance. For example, phrases like “I promise to sell you my car unless I decide not to,” “I promise to buy as many bushels of wheat from you as I want,” “I reserve the power to terminate the agreement at any time,” “I will if I want to.” Anything you can imagine that would remove the obligation of the promisor is an illusory promise.  Rules of thumb: “Want” is different from “need” If performance is entirely within one party’s control, it might be illusory, but court will impose obligation of best efforts such as “I promise to use my best efforts to try to get a lease on the property.”

**Restatement §77:** A promise or apparent promise is NOT consideration if by its terms the promisor or purported promisor reserves a choice of alternative performances [retaining right to end “promise” at any time without notice hypo].

IF NO CONSIDERATION, GO TO ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES

**Langer v. Superior Steel Corp.**

- The court held that Langer’s act of refraining from seeking competitive employment constitutes sufficient consideration for an enforceable contract with Superior. Sufficient consideration for an enforceable contract exists when one party agrees to do something or refrains from doing anything that he has a right to do, regardless of whether doing so causes any actual detriment to him or confers any actual benefit upon the other party. [employer awarded $100 pension upon retirement with condition to refrain from competitive employment].

**White v. Village of Homewood (Fire and Police Commission)**  

- The court held that a pre-existing legal duty is not sufficient consideration for a binding contract. Exculpatory contracts/releases are generally enforceable if supported by actual consideration. Consideration cannot consist of an obligation that a party is already legally required to perform and in the present case, the village was legally obligated to administer the test that plaintiff took and sustained injuries from.

# Reliance Principle

The reliance principle seeks to protect those who reasonably rely on others. Some maintain that it is reasonable to rely on another person in a variety of different circumstances, while others maintain that it is only reasonable to rely on another person if that person has promised to do something or otherwise voluntarily invited the reliance. As a result of this limitation, the reliance principle in current law emphasizes promises, with the belief that promises should be kept and whether obligation should ever be imposed in the absence of a promise. The reliance principle is corrective or restorative; it holds that a person who has been injured should be compensated for that injury (a corrective or restorative claim). In contrast, the bargain principle is distributive; it holds that the existence of a bargain entitles each person to the benefit he or she expected from the claim (a distributive claim).

---

# Reliance Theory

The reliance theory involves promises to give gifts, and seeks to protect those who reasonably rely on others. *See the reliance principle for longer rule and below for other rule*

Reliance Theory is an alternative ground for recovery when there’s no exchange or no consideration.  Reliance theory is based on the belief that (1) in some cases, a person who is injured ought to be compensated for that injury, and (2) a person who causes injury or harm ought to be accountable for it. Reliance theory assumes that people do rely on each other and that such reliance is morally and politically valuable. Reliance theory doesn't protect *promises*; it protects reliance.

In contrast, the idea underlying the bargain theory and the doctrine of consideration values exchange and the marketplace. This is why the question of whether a promise to give a gift should ever be enforceable is controversial. If we say yes, we’re risking undermining the basis of the bargain theory. One’s view of the bargain theory is really one’s view of consideration; if your view is that consideration is very important, you’re not going to think much of reliance theory. However, if you think that consideration is not always a valid basis for enforcing promises because sometimes although there's no consideration, people might rely on a promise and that’s valuable.   

The family context is very private so that’s a place the court might not intervene – but there’s a whole school of thought that says that promises even in the family sphere and in the private sphere have value and should be enforced.  

Reliance Theory based on:

1. A person who is injured ought to be compensated for that injury (in some cases)
2. One who causes harm ought to be accountable for it

Assumptions

- People do rely on each other
- Such reliance is morally and politically valuable
- Reliance theory doesn’t protect promises – it protects reliance. – (not all promises are enforceable; the rules are not protecting promises; however, once the other party reasonably relies on the promise, you can’t take it back)

---

### Rule for Recovery Under Reliance Theory

(Promissory estoppel) (§ 90)** (these are Zalesne’s elements - Elements (section 90 is not worded in this way).

1. PROMISE (objective test) – rule is objective test; would a reasonable person think they were making a promise
2. RELIANCE - on the promise (change of position) – change of position because of the promise – I wasn’t going to go to college but you made a promise so based on promise I’m going to go. –
3. REASONABLE - Reliance must be REASONABLE (context/factors) - Factors – context – who parties are -
4. HARM - Reliance must have caused HARM (beyond not getting the thing promised) – harm can’t be I promise to give you 5000 dollars and then you feel harmed when you don’t have 5000 dollars. But if you can show that because of the reliance you were harmed. Say I promise you 5000 dollars and you go buy a car – must show that you’re worse off than you were before the promise.

---

## Promissory estoppel

Promissory estoppel comes from the doctrine of equitable estoppel, where if a person makes a representation about a fact, in a situation in which another person is likely to rely on the truth of that fact (sometimes in the context of litigation and sometimes in other contexts), then the first person is barred ("estopped") from denying the truth of the fact as he or she stated it. (45) In *Ricketts v. Scothorn*, Judge Sullivan applied the idea of equitable estoppel to a promise, instead of a statement of fact. So under Ricketts, if a person says, in effect, "I will do this," in a situation in which reliance is reasonable and foreseeable, he or she may later be estopped from saying "I will not do this" or "my promise is not enforceable."

To really understand promissory estoppel, you have to look at the interplay between the bargain theory and reliance theory. We saw a real limitation to the bargain theory in Childess, where ... *State Bank of Standish v. Curry* is the perfect example of the power dynamics between the bank and the family farm. There is a huge imbalance where the Bank says “we’ll take care of you” and the farmers have to trust. A flexible court sees the value of trust – the importance of trust when there is a power imbalance – and that is the approach the court took in Standish.  

Courts may enforce a promise that is not part of an exchange under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, codified in RST § 90(1) which states that "a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for the breach may be limited as justice requires." A promise is defined as "a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made." RST § 2(1). The focus of promissory estoppel is on the circumstances of trust, so the requirement of a promise is shaped by a court's views about the social dimension of trust. Some courts insist that reliance cannot be expected or reasonable unless the promise is "clear and unambiguous." Other courts find that mere "representations" can be sufficient expressions of commitment to induce expected and reasonable reliance.   

Flexible Approach is most commonly seen in cases of deals-that-never-happen. In these cases, each side pays its own reliance costs. The court has to make sure reliance is reasonable when there is reliance despite the lack of a deal (when a deal is anticipated). The court looks at the words, and the relations of the parties. Lender-borrower; banker-farmer: dependency, trust, stronger party, weaker party. In Standish, the bank should really expect that the Currys would think that the bank was making a promise where in direct response to the Stanfords’ questions the bank said “don’t worry, we will support you;” this is similar to Embry, where Embry asked whether he still had a job and McKittrich said, “don’t worry, get your men out.” In Standish the bank similarly didn’t use direct words of promise but spoke in direct response to the Currys' question, and in the context of a year after year relationship where they always rolled over from year to year so the terms were generally understood.

---

## Flexible approach and strict approach

**Strict Approach** (fear that the reliance theory will take over the bargain theory)

- Promise must be as definite, comprehensive, and unequivocal as an offer.
- **If there’s no offer, then there’s no promise. If there's no promise, there's no promisory estoppel. It sucks.**
- As Promissory estoppel is an alternative theory, we don’t want to allow it to completely negate the requirement of consideration.

**Flexible approach**

- Promise triggering reliance doesn’t have to be as comprehensive as an offer.
- Parties don’t always expressly state things, but reasonable people might still rely.
- The contract model is inadequate to evaluate trust in situations of power inequity / dependency

## Steps of analysis reliance theory

Four elements – argue from one perspective, argue from another, and then the more complicated is the approach – flexible or strict.

### Cases

**Ricketts v. Scothorn**

In Ricketts v. Scothorn, Judge Sullivan applied the idea of equitable estoppel to a promise, instead of a statement of fact. So under Ricketts, if a person says, in effect, "I will do this," in a situation in which reliance is reasonable and foreseeable, he or she may later be estopped from saying "I will not do this" or "my promise is not enforceable."

Facts and finding: In Ricketts, a grandfather promised granddaughter he’d pay her $2000 + 6% interest, The granddaughter quit her job and didn’t work for a year. A year later she got another job. The Grandfather passed away and had only paid one year’s interest on the note. The court found that the bargain principle does not apply and that there was no contract because there was no quid pro quo.  “Mr. Ricketts made no condition, requirement … nothing in return”

Policy: By evoking the estoppel doctrine, Judge Sullivan also evokes the residual judicial power to do "equity" within the body of law called "equity," which is characterized by relatively open claims to justice. (45)

**Kirksey v. Kirksey** (Supreme Court of Alabama 1845) *also in restitution theory!*

In Kirksey v. Kirksey, the court ruled that there was no enforceable promise where the plaintiff's brother-in-law promised plaintiff that if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family." The court reasoned that because the promise was a gift and not an exchange where the plaintiff did not agree to do anything in exchange for living on defendant's farm, which made the promise a gift. The plaintiff argued that there was exchange because she worked on the defendant's farm, which enriched the defendant. Under the reliance theory the promise would have been binding because she relied on the defendant's promise.

**State Bank of Standish v. Curry**

- In *State Bank of Standish v. Curry*, the Currys been borrowing from the bank for ten years. 1983 to 1993. Had outstanding balance of $167,000. Government started buy out program. This would have allowed them to pay their debts if they won the bids. They asked bank if the bank would continue to give them yearly loan. Bank said: “the Currys were doing a great job and had made all their payments and that there was no reason to worry about their future in the dairy business because the bank would support them.” (244) The Bank sues for money owed and Currys sue for promissory estoppel.
- The Currys didn’t bring their case as bargain theory because there was really no offer. The bank’s language was too vague; there were no specific terms. There was only a promise to make an offer in the future. It’s different from I promise to give you a loan for this much if you promise to pay me interest.
- So court says is there is no offer, but there might be a promise. – some courts will use it in a very narrow way. Two views.

# Restitution theory

**Kirksey v. Kirksey** (Supreme Court of Alabama 1845) *also in reliance theory!*

In Kirksey v. Kirksey, the court ruled that there was no enforceable promise where the plaintiff's brother-in-law promised plaintiff that if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family." The court reasoned that because the promise was a gift and not an exchange where the plaintiff did not agree to do anything in exchange for living on defendant's farm, which made the promise a gift. Under the restitution theory, which holds that one ought to pay for any benefit unjustly retained, the promise might be binding because there is an argument that the defendant was unjustly enriched.

**Fluffy white dog hypo:** Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals.

- **Answer/rule:** Under the restitution theory, the owner would have to repay me for the out-of-pocket costs I incurred because when somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog there is an obligation to compensate because the dog owner was unjustly enriched.

# Statute of Frauds

If we can say yes, yes, yes to the three elements of contract formation, we go to statute of frauds. The statute of frauds is a sort of threshold for the bargain theory. We have to go through it to make a contract enforceable.

Does the statute of frauds apply? Is the statute of frauds satisfied?

**If the statute of frauds is not satisfied, we go back to promissory estoppel or restitution.**

**If the statute of frauds is satisfied, we go to a bunch of other rules.**

If I’m suing you, you have to have signed it. I obviously believe a contract exists because I’m suing you. The question is whether a contract exists. Your signature can be a signature in a very loose context, such as an x, a letterhead, an email, whatever.

The statute of frauds goes back to 16th century England perjury - it aims to stop people from bringing false claims. If words are in writing, you can still commit forgery, but it’s harder to do than perjury. In England, people could not testify on their own behalf. They would get other people to go on the stand, so there was perjury, and the statute of frauds was designed to prevent it. Now people can go on the stand and testify on their own behalf, so in England they felt they didn’t need the statute of frauds and got rid of it. We still have the statute of frauds in the U.S. (with UCC article 2 the statute of frauds in amendments kept being taken out and then being put back in).

The purpose of the statute of frauds is to put things in writing. Also, it’s supposed to prevent compulsive purchases, such as real estate, to encourage people to think before making a really big purchase. The following fall within the statute of frauds (Prof. Zalesne not going to talk about 1 and 3)

2. Ks of suretyship (surety is a person liable for the duty of another person. Both principle and surety are liable to a third person [principal is the original debtor; creditor is the person to whom debt is owned; surety is the promise to pay creditor). A surety contract doesn’t have to be in writing except when there is no consideration. The time that it needs to be in writing is when you agree to guarantee someone. You have to put it in writing because it’s a bit thing to guarantee someone else.
4. K for the sale of land and/or real estate (real property house and land)
6. K for the sale of goods for more than $500 (in the UCC this is the rule and then there are a bunch of exceptions)
5. K for the sale of goods that can’t be performed in one year from the making of the contract (if a promise of either party cannot be performed within one year, the contract has to be in writing. Courts hate this one and if there’s any way to perform this that does not require writing courts will use that.  

**Hypos**

1.	Ten month employment K. Does it need to be in writing? It depends because we don’t know when the contract was signed. If the employment is going to start in September, then its a ten month contract starting in September and if its signed today then the contract is for more than 12 months. It only depends because we didn’t get enough information about when the contract will start; not because things can happen in the future.
2.	K to be performed at a the death of a person. No, doesn’t have to be in writing because a contract that is indefinite in terms does not have to be in writing. (If you want it to be required to be in writing you can make it two years)
3.	A promises to work for B for the rest of A’s life (or the rest of B’s life). Does it need to be in writing? This hypo is identical to the last one. It does not have to be in writing because there is the possibly that a person will die within a year.
4.	Comfort Arms promises to care for Betty for 18 months. Does it need to be in writing? Yes. If Betty passes away before 18 months, contract still exists; performance can be excused, but this does need to be in writing because it can’t be performed in less than a year.
5.	K to build a full-scale replica of empire state building. Does it need to be in writing? No because if a zillion people build it it could be done in less than a year.
6.	K for permanent employment - Does it need to be in writing? if it means until you’re 65 yes you need writing if more vague no
7.	Two year K to sell all the grain you shall need for $100/barrel. Does it need to be in writing? The two-year rule does not apply because it’s the sale of goods. No, because it’s sale of goods and the grain may be sold for less than $500 (person might need fewer than 5 barrels) - there’s no guarantee that I will need at least 5 barrels of grain so no, it probably doesn’t have to be in writing. Because it’s about the sale of goods, the UCC applies. None of the other rules apply. However, some courts might say that based on history, you will need more than 5 barrels so yes, writing is required.
8.	Eight-month K subject to renewal. Does it need to be in writing? No, because at the time of entering contract as the hypo stands, it is less than a year. Other relevant conditions are unknown and could change the facts and analysis.

**EXCEPTION**

Party is estopped from asserting the SOF if full performance (some courts only require partial)

**Hypo: relationship to promissory estoppel**

- P (landlord) and D (tenant) enter into a K
- 2 year lease
- P promises to make renovations first - necessary before D will sign contract
- P makes renovations
- D never moved in and refuses to pay
- No writing. P sues
- What result under bargain theory?
- What result under restitution theory?
- What result under reliance theory?
- The first question is is there an enforceable contract
- The first sub-question is is a writing required? Yes
- Can landlord sue under restitution theory? The landlord can’t sue under restitution because was fixing own property; tenant never moved in so landlord never conferred a benefit on tenant.
What result under reliance theory? The landlord is saying that the tenant promised to live in the apartment and pay rent. Tenant says doesn’t apply because not in writing. That would have worked under bargain theory. The question under reliance theory is landlord saying you promised to live here, I relied on it. I made the renovations. I’m harmed. (Maybe not harmed). Here landlord could say I made the renovations in reliance on your promise. In a strict court you would lose anyway. You didn’t put it in writing. A flexible court would say that the bargain theory failed because the tenant promised that if landlord did renovations, they would sign contract, so the landlord had to do renovations.

# Seven Defenses

There are seven defenses (illegality goes with public policy)

---

## Illegality

Generally, a contract or contract term that is illegal (violates a statute) or is against public policy will not be enforced. However, not every violation of a statute will create a policy concern strong enough to deny enforcement of an otherwise valid contract. When determining whether a contract which violates a statute should be enforced, courts consider

- What the relevant fault of the two parties was.
- What degree of harm was caused by the violation of the statutory scheme
- Whether the entire contract was illegal or just one part of it
- Whether one party will be harmed in a way that’s disproportionate to the harm done by violating the statute
- Whether enforcing the contract will encourage people to violate the law
- Whether refusing to enforce the contract will deter illegal conduct

---

## Public Policy

In general, parties may contract as they wish, and courts will enforce their agreements without passing on their substance. Sometimes, however, a court will decide that the interest in freedom of contract is outweighed by some overriding interest of society and will refuse to enforce a promise or other term on grounds of public policy. When determining whether a contract should not be enforced for public policy reasons, courts look at competing private values of individual freedom vs. public values of social regulation. Often these competing values are expressed as the private interest in freedom of choice competing against a public interest in some other policy, or as free market economic notions competing against moral values.

Under the RST § 179, a public policy against the enforcement of promises or other terms may be derived by the court from (a) legislation relevant to such a policy, or (b) the need to protect some aspect of the public welfare, as is the case for the judicial policies against, for example (i) restraint of trade (§§ 186-188), (ii) impairment of family relations (§§ 189-191), and (iii) interference with other protected interests (§§ 192-196, 356). Policies tend to be grounded in moral values, economic notions and the protection of government institutions.

### Framework for Public Policy

**Arguments to enforce:**

- Freedom of choice, assent
- Protect justified expectations
- Other policy arguments in favor of the subject matter of the contract

**Arguments not to enforce:**

1. What policies?
2. Who is the court protecting?
3. What interests? (moral, economic, etc.)

**Commodification arguments:**

- Pure commodification:  The belief that real welfare is always promoted by permitting exchange.  Everything can be commodified (made available on open markets and therefore the subjects of contracts)
- Critique: Certain things (with emotional content) should not be contactable or commodifiable. (e.g., not right to treat children the same as goods)

---

## Capacity

The first issue is whether Marie can disaffirm the contract.

Under Restatement Second § 20, capacity means the legal power which a normal person would have under the same circumstances. Incapacity may be total, as in cases where extreme physical or mental disability prevents manifestation of assent to the transaction, or in cases of mental illness after a guardian has been appointed. Often, however, lack of capacity merely renders contracts voidable. See § 7. Incapacity sometimes relates only to particular types of transactions; on the other hand, persons whose capacity is limited in most circumstances may be bound by particular types of transactions. In cases of partial disability, the law of mistake or of misrepresentation, duress and undue influence may be relevant. See Chapters 6 and 7, particularly §§ 153, 157, 161(d), 163, 164, 167, 169(c) and 177, Comment b to § 172 and Comment c to § 175. The principal categories of natural persons having no capacity or limited capacity to contract include minors and the mentally ill. (Historically, the categories were married women, infants, and what were formerly referred to as insane persons [RST Second § 12])

The risks of undoing a contract if one party is unable to understand the terms include causing a lack of stability of contractual relations by forfeiture, the perpetuation of stereotypes, the perpetuation of parentalistic stances, and taking away agency of a contracting party (for example, a victim of domestic violence being portrayed as lacking agency due to diminished capacity). Subordination and discrimination can deprive people of the right to contract and limit market activity of particular groups; the legacy of contractual incapacity produces implicit and systemic bias, disparate pricing, and racial stereotyping. The capacity doctrine can take away agency of certain groups, either intentionally or not.

Courts seek a balance between the stability of contract relations and the protection of people who cannot protect themselves. Although courts generally do not look at the fairness of contracts (neo-classical economic theory assumes that parties are acting in their own best interest and are fully informed), in questions of capacity they do look at unfairness to some extent when they attempt to determine whether a person is unable to negotiate their own best interest. In the course of making this determination, courts distinguish between procedural and substantive unfairness.

Procedural unfairness is unfairness in the bargaining process where there is an imbalance of power and one of the parties takes advantage of their superior bargaining power. Substantive unfairness is unfairness in the resulting terms. Courts are more likely to police the bargain if there’s been procedural unfairness.

## Minority

The question is whether minor can disaffirm the contract.

The general rule is that all contracts with minors are voidable (§ 14). Exceptions to the general rule are Emancipation by marriage, military service or when the minor is living apart and independently from parents (requires judicial proceeding). Generally, when a minor disaffirms, they don't have to pay restitution. Generally, when a minor disaffirms, they don’t have to pay restitution. They must return the property but can get all their money back, and don’t have to pay for use or depreciation or any damage to the goods. Exceptions to restitution rule are misrepresentation, tortious damage to property, or willful destruction of property. Minors are less protected when buying necessities. A minor can avoid a contract for necessities but still has to pay for the loss of value of the goods.

**See Writing Assignment 3**

## Mental Incapacity

There are two tests for mental incapacity. (RST § 15(1)). Cognitive test: (traditional test): Unable to understand in a reasonable manner the nature and consequences of the transaction. Volitional test: Unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other party has reason to know of his condition

Restitution is required in full to the extent of any benefit received unless the other party had knowledge of the incompetency. POLICY CONCERNS LOOK IN OTHER OUTLINE.

**Four Elements of RST §175(1)**

Under RST § 175(1), if a party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the contract is voidable by the victim. This can be broken down into four elements. (1) There must be a threat; (2) the threat must be improper; (3) the threat must induce victim’s manifestation of assent; (4) there must be no reasonable alternative (threat must be sufficiently grave to justify the victim’s assent / irreparable harm).

- **Element 1:** Under RST § 175 a threat is a manifestation of intent to inflict some loss or harm on another. A threat may be inferred from words or conduct.
- **Element 2:** Under RST § 176, a threat is improper when (1) (a) what is threatened is a crime or a tort, ... (b) what is threatened is a criminal prosecution, (c) what is threatened is civil prosecution made in bad faith, or (d) the threat is a breach of contract made in bad faith. (2) A threat is improper if the resulting exchange is not on fair terms, **AND** (a) the threatened act would harm the recipient and would not significantly benefit the party making the threat, **OR** (b) the effectiveness of the threat in inducing the manifestation of assent is significantly increased by prior unfair dealing by the party making the threat, **OR** (c) what is threatened is otherwise a use of power for illegitimate ends. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 176 (1981).
- **Element 3:** Courts apply a subjective test to determine whether the threat induced the victim's manifestation of assent. In applying this test the court considers the age, background, and relationship of the parties, and asks whether (A) the parties were going to sign anyway (whether they are not signing because of the threat); or (B) they weren’t going to sign but decided to after the threat.
- **Element 4:** The next sub-issue is whether the victim had no reasonable alternative to manifesting assent because the threat was sufficiently severe to justify assent. In determining whether the victim had no reasonable alternative to manifesting assent, courts look at the seriousness of the threat by examining (A) the nature of the threat and the severity of the thing being threatened, and (B) the likelihood of the person following through, as well as (C) whether there were alternatives such as the person just walking away and suing.

**Three Elements of RST §175(2)**  

Under RST § 175(2), if a party's manifestation of assent is induced by one who is not a party to the transaction, the contract is voidable by the victim unless (1) the other party (the "other party" is the contracting party who is not the "victim" under duress) acted in good faith; (2) the other party didn't know of the duress, **AND** (3) the other party either gives value or relies materially on the transaction. The other party must establish all three elements to escape a claim of duress by a third party. *The two keys are did the other party know and did the other party rely*

## Economic duress

One party threatens to breach the agreement unless the other party agrees to some further demand. “I won’t perform under this existing contract unless you pay me more money.”

*To show economic duress:*

- Must meet all the elements of duress
- Element 2 is met by threat to breach the contract if other party doesn’t give in to demands (§ 176(1)(d): must be “breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing under a contract”).
- Element 4 must show that breach will result in irreparable harm and there are no reasonable alternatives. Irreparable harm could be that (a) goods are scarce; (b) need is desperate; (c) price is exorbitant; (d) there are no reasonable alternatives.

Example of economic duress: Two parties enter into an agreement to build a house. Upon satisfactory performance (house is built), builder demands payment but owner refuses.
Owner knows builder is in dire financial need. “Negotiates” a settlement and release agreement below the contract price. E.g., owner owes builder $1 million.  I won’t pay you unless you lower it to $800,000. **Not enough to show threatened breach of contract**

Another example of economic duress: Tenant is renting an apartment for $500/month (year lease). Midyear: I’ll only continue to rent you this apartment if you pay me $700/month for the rest of the lease. There’s a shortage of decent affordable housing. Tenant has no choice but to agree.

## Statutes

**§ 174:  Duress by Physical Compulsion. Void**

Formation of a Contract is prevented if conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by a party who does not intend to engage in that conduct is physically compelled by duress, the conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 174 (1981).

**§ 175:  Duress by Threat. Voidable**

A contract is voidable in the following instances: (1) If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the contract is voidable by the victim; or (2) If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by one who is not a party to the transaction, the contract is voidable by the victim unless the other party to the transaction in good faith and without reason to know of the duress either gives value or relies materially on the transaction. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 175 (1981).

**Lorna Bond Rule**

Bond court broadened RST § 174. More situations where a contract might be void. Under the Lorna Bond rule, a contract is void if there was (1) duress by actual physical compulsion; **OR**  (2) duress by threat of physical violence in such magnitude as to cause a reasonable person to fear (i) loss of life; (ii) serious physical injury; **OR** (iii) actual imprisonment. There is no requirement that the other party knew of the threats.

## Steps of analysis

R: Under the Restatement Second, [RULE w/elements] **+ POLICY!!! (I don't have enough policy in my rules)**

I: The question is whether the contract is voidable where there was a mistake.  

R: Under the Restatement Second, a mistake can make a contract voidable. A mistake is "a belief that is not in accord with the facts" (§ 151). The mistake must relate to the facts as they exist at the time of entering into the contract, and the mistaken assumption must be a type of mistake covered by the mistake doctrine. The types of mistake covered in this doctrine are mistake of fact, mistake of law, misunderstanding/interpretation, improvident act, mistaken prediction about the future, and mistake in expression. The mistake can be mutual or unilateral.

A: Here, there was a mistake and it was a [type of mistake] because ...

C: Therefore, the contract may be voidable because there was a [type of mistake]

I: The next issue is whether the mistake was mutual or unilateral.

**IF MUTUAL**

R: Under Restatement Second § 152, a mistake mutually made by both parties at the time a contract is made is voidable if (1) the mistake was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made (2) the mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, **AND** (3), the party seeking relief did not assume the risk of the mistake.

A:

I: The first sub-issue is whether the mistake was mutually made.

R: A mistake is mutual if both parties did not have independent knowledge of the true facts.

A: Here, there was a mutual mistake because both parties did not have independent knowledge of the true facts where ...

C: Therefore, the mistake is mutual.

**IF UNILATERAL**

Under Restatement Second § 153, a mistake made unilaterally (by one party) makes the contract voidable if (1) the mistake was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made (2) the mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, **AND** (3), the party seeking relief did not assume the risk of the mistake.

A:

I: The first sub-issue is whether the mistake was made by only one party.

R: When the mistake is unilateral, the mistake only makes the contract voidable if (a) the other party (the party not under the mistaken belief) knows the true fact; OR (b) the other party has no belief or independent knowledge of the true fact (when, for example, the other party gets their knowledge from the first party).

A: Here, the mistake was unilateral because all of the information came from [one of the parties] where ... and … like in …

C: Therefore, the mistake is unilateral.

**BASIC ASSUMPTION**

I: The next issue is what facts the mistake was about.

R: Under Restatement Second of Contracts, for a mistake to make a contract voidable the mistake must be made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made.

A: Here, ...

Therefore, ...

**MATERIAL MISTAKE**

I: The next sub-issue is whether the mistake was a material mistake.

R: Under Restatement Second of Contracts, for a mistake to make a contract voidable the mistake must have a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances. Courts determine materiality by looking at facts such as price disparity.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

**RISK**  

I: The next issue is whether the party seeking relief assumed risk.

R: Under Restatement Second § 154, a party bears the risk of a mistake when (a) the risk is allocated to her by agreement of the parties, **OR** (b) she is aware, at the time the contract is made, that she has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats her limited knowledge as sufficient (conscious ignorance), **OR** (c) the risk is allocated to her by the court. Courts apply the objective test to the terms of the agreement, asking whether a reasonable person would have been aware of the risk.

A: Here,

C: Therefore, the party did/did not bear the risk.

*IF MUTUAL:* C: Therefore, mutual mistake is satisfied/not satisfied.

**ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR UNILATERAL MISTAKE: UNCONSCIONABLE**

I: The last issue is whether the other party was unconscionable or had reason to know of the mistake.

R: If a court finds that the other party should have known that the first party was making a mistake but was unconscious of the mistake through inattention or negligence, the other party is assumed to know of the first party's mistake, which makes the mistake mutual. To determine whether the other party acted unconscionably, the court applies the objective test (what would a reasonable person in the other party's position have assumed). The policy reason for this requirement is that the other party should not be able to profit from the first party’s innocent mistake. If one party knows of the interpretation of the other party, the court will enforce the contract on the terms assigned by the innocent party.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, unilateral mistake satisfied/not satisfied.

C: Therefore, a court would likely find that ...

## Statutes

**§ 151 Mistake Defined**

A mistake is a belief that is not in accord with the facts. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 151 (1981).

**§ 152 When Mistake of Both Parties Makes a Contract Voidable**

(1) Where a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in § 154. (2) In determining whether the mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, account is taken of any relief by way of reformation, restitution, or otherwise. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 152 (1981)

**§ 153 When Mistake of One Party Makes a Contract Voidable**

Where a mistake of one party at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which he made the contract has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him, the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in § 154, and (a) the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, or (b) the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 153 (1981).

**§ 154 When a Party Bears the Risk of a Mistake**

A party bears the risk of a mistake when (a) the risk is allocated to him by agreement of the parties, or (b) he is aware, at the time the contract is made, that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats his limited knowledge as sufficient, or (c) the risk is allocated to him by the court on the ground that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so. The issue is whether the defense of unilateral mistake will prevent enforcement of the contract. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 154 (1981).

**§ 155 When Mistake of Both Parties as to Written Expression Justifies Reformation**

Where a writing that evidences or embodies an agreement in whole or in part fails to express the agreement because of a mistake of both parties as to the contents or effect of the writing, the court may at the request of a party reform the writing to express the agreement, except to the extent that rights of third parties such as good faith purchasers for value will be unfairly affected. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 155 (1981).

**§ 156 Mistake as to Contract Within the Statute of Frauds**

If reformation of a writing is otherwise appropriate, it is not precluded by the fact that the contract is within the Statute of Frauds. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 156 (1981).

**§ 157 Effect of Fault of Party Seeking Relief**

A mistaken party's fault in failing to know or discover the facts before making the contract does not bar him from avoidance or reformation under the rules stated in this Chapter, unless his fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 157 (1981).

**§ 158 Relief Including Restitution**

(1) In any case governed by the rules stated in this Chapter, either party may have a claim for relief including restitution under the rules stated in §§ 240 and 376. (2) In any case governed by the rules stated in this Chapter, if those rules together with the rules stated in Chapter 16 will not avoid injustice, the court may grant relief on such terms as justice requires including protection of the parties' reliance interests. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 158 (1981)

# Misrepresentation

Statutes are towards the end of this section.

---

## Steps of analysis

I: The question is whether misrepresentation makes the contract voidable where ...

R: Under the Restatement Second, a contract can be voidable if (1) it contains an assertion that is not in accord with the facts. For a court to find that such an assertion amounts to misrepresentation, the assertion must (2) be material or fraudulent, (3) have induced the other party to enter into the contract, and (4) justified reliance on the contract.

A:

I: The first issue is whether the [assertion in the contract] misrepresents the facts.

R: The Restatement Second § 159 defines misrepresentation as "an assertion that is not in accord with the facts." The misrepresentation cannot be an opinion or a half-truth, but it can be a non-disclosure or concealment of a fact. An action intended or known to be likely to prevent another from learning a fact is equivalent to an assertion that the fact does not exist.

A: Here, the assertion ... is not in accord with the facts because .... The assertion is not an opinion because ... nor is it a half-truth because ... Like Vokes, where ... , [the party]'s assertion was not a half-truth because ... . Here, the misrepresentation is a non-disclosure/concealment of a fact because ...

C: Therefore, the [assertion] is a misrepresentation.

I: The second issue is whether the misrepresentation is material or fraudulent.

R: Under the Restatement Second, a misrepresentation is material or fraudulent if (1) it is intended to mislead, and (2) likely to induce a reasonable person. Courts apply the positioned reasonable person test to determine whether a party is likely to be misled.

A:

I: The first sub-issue is whether the intention of the misrepresenting party intended to mislead.

R: Intention is assessed by the courts by looking at the surrounding circumstances.(? not sure about this)

A: Here, the assertion that [assertion] is clearly intended to mislead because ...

C: Therefore, the [assertion] satisfies the first requirement for material or fraudulent.

I: The second sub-issue is whether the misrepresentation induced [the party] to enter into the contract.

R: To determine whether a party would likely be induced, courts ask whether a reasonable person in the other party's position would have been induced.

A: Here, the other party was likely induced to enter into a contract because a reasonable person in the position of [party] would have ...

C: Therefore, the second requirement for material or fraudulent is satisfied.

C: Therefore, the [assertion] is material or fraudulent because both requirements for material or fraudelent are satisfied.

I: The third issue is whether the misrepresentation actually induced assent.  

R: For a court to find that a misrepresentation induced assent, the misrepresentation does not have to be the sole or even predominant reason why the party assented to an offer, but it must have substantially contributed to the party's decision.

A: Here, although [the party's] assertion that ... was not the sole reason why [the party] assented, it contributed substantially to the party assenting because ...

C: Therefore, the element of actually inducing assent is satisfied.

I: The fourth issue is whether reliance on the misrepresentation was justified.

R: Reliance on a misrepresentation is justified if the misrepresentation was reasonably credible. It is not reasonable to rely on a misrepresention if it was obviously false or if it was just an opinion, nor is it reasonable to rely on a misrespresentation through a failure to read or a failure to investigate the misrepresentative assertion. Normally there is a duty to read, but when an oral statement conflicts with a written contract, courts ask whether reliance on the oral statement was reasonable. To determine whether the reliance was reasonable, courts consider context, asking who relied on what and why.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, the element of reliance is satisfied.

C: Therefore, the contract is voidable because there was misrepresentation.

**There is also a duty to disclose (see below). Not sure where to put it. Maybe in element 1.**

## Summary of Four Elements

1. Misrepresentation (§ 159)
2. Material or fraudulent (§ 162)
3. Induced other party to accept       (§ 167)
4. Justified reliance (§§ 169, 171, 172)

**Element 1: Misrepresentation**

- Definition § 159
- Can’t be opinion (§§ 168, 169)
- Can be half-truth (Vokes)
- Can be non-disclosure (§ 161)
- Can be concealment (§ 160)

**Element 2: Fraudulent or Material**

- Fraudulent § 162(1): Intended to mislead
- Material § 162(2):Likely to induce a reasonable person.

**Element 3: Actually induce assent**

- Doesn’t need to be sole or even predominant reason
- Must have substantially contributed to party’s decision
- Triggering facts?

**Element 4: Was reliance justified**

Not reasonable to rely if

- Misrep was obviously false
- Misrep was just an opinion
- Failure to read or investigate

## Puffing

- Exaggerated claims on which no reasonable person would rely
- Generalized statements, not making specific claims
- General claim of superiority over a comparable product that is so vague it would be understood as mere opinion.

**Puffing Hypo**

- Papa Johns runs a series of ads claiming it makes “better pizza” and touting the “superiority” of its sauce and its dough
- Does consumer assume its sauce is made from fresh and vine-ripened tomatoes – not remanufactured tomato paste
- Dough is fresh, not frozen etc.?

**Burger King Commercial**

“Our burger has more meat than McDonalds’ fried quarter pounder.  That’s a fact.  We think it tastes better too, but that’s our opinion.”

**Snapple**

“Made from the best stuff on earth” (what if they used high fructose corn syrup and did not use organic ingredients)

## Theoretical perspective

- What theoretical perspective (economic) was the case decided from?
- How would the case be decided under alternative approach?

**Neo-classical economic approach** Argue for the enforcement of the K; **Use policy arguments in the analysis of each of the four elements**

1. Just an opinion… (What must the court have assumed about Vokes? Challenge those assumptions)
2. Not fraudulent or material…
3. She would have assented anyway…
4. Reliance not reasonable…

Compare *Parker v. Arthur Murray*

Could the Vokes case be rewritten to protect Vokes from predatory behavior without portraying her as weak, fragile, helpless, vulnerable, lonely…?

## Duty to disclose

- Normally no duty to disclose
- Parties should be able to deal at arms length
- Duty to investigate / ask questions
- Some exceptions…

§ 161 When a failure to disclose amounts to an assertion not in accordance with the facts

- To prevent previous assertion from being a misrepresentation
- To correct a mistake of the other party as to a basic assumption of the contract
- To correct a mistake of the other party as to the terms of the writing
- When fiduciary relationship

**Duty to Disclose Hypo**

An honest man has imported a large cargo of grain during time of famine.  Several other importers are coming with more grain. Should/can he sell the grain at very high prices, or should he tell the buyers the other grain is coming and sell at competitive prices?

## Kang v. Harrington (p 425)

This case is about the responsibility the law places on the “innocent” party. Duty to read / duty to investigate, discover… Dolly Won rented a house to Dewey Harrington. They agreed to a one-year lease with an option to renew for an additional year. $400 security deposit. Letter of intent had errors: Included the wrong address and said the $400 security deposit was the first month’s rent (rather than the security deposit). The lease was typed up by Harrington. Problem with lease: the lease included an additional provision (that they hadn’t agreed to) giving Harrington a perpetual option to rent the property at $400/month (rather than a one-year option). Did she agree to the perpetual option? Did she have a duty to read?

## Statutes

**§ 159 Misrepresentation Defined** A misrepresentation is an assertion that is not in accord with the facts.

**§ 160 When Action is Equivalent to an Assertion (Concealment)** Action intended or known to be likely to prevent another from learning a fact is equivalent to an assertion that the fact does not exist.

**§ 161 When Non-Disclosure Is Equivalent to an Assertion** A person's non-disclosure of a fact known to him is equivalent to an assertion that the fact does not exist in the following cases only: (a) where he knows that disclosure of the fact is necessary to prevent some previous assertion from being a misrepresentation or from being fraudulent or material. (b) where he knows that disclosure of the fact would correct a mistake of the other party as to a basic assumption on which that party is making the contract and if non-disclosure of the fact amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing. (c) where he knows that disclosure of the fact would correct a mistake of the other party as to the contents or effect of a writing, evidencing or embodying an agreement in whole or in part. (d) where the other person is entitled to know the fact because of a relation of trust and confidence between them

**§ 162 When a Misrepresentation Is Fraudulent or Material** (1) A misrepresentation is fraudulent if the maker intends his assertion to induce a party to manifest his assent and the maker (a) knows or believes that the assertion is not in accord with the facts, or (b) does not have the confidence that he states or implies in the truth of the assertion, or (c) knows that he does not have the basis that he states or implies for the assertion. (2) A misrepresentation is material if it would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent, or if the maker knows that it would be likely to induce the recipient to do so.

**§ 163 When a Misrepresentation Prevents Formation of a Contract** If a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract induces conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by one who neither knows nor has reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract, his conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.

**§ 164 When a Misrepresentation Makes a Contract Voidable** (1) If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying, the contract is voidable by the recipient. (2) If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by one who is not a party to the transaction upon which the recipient is justified in relying, the contract is voidable by the recipient, unless the other party to the transaction in good faith and without reason to know of the misrepresentation either gives value or relies materially on the transaction.

*What’s the difference between sections 163 and 164?*

**§ 167 When a Misrepresentation Is an Inducing Cause** A misrepresentation induces a party's manifestation of assent if it substantially contributes to his decision to manifest his assent.

**§ 168 Reliance on Assertions of Opinion** (1) An assertion is one of opinion if it expresses only a belief, without certainty, as to the existence of a fact or expresses only a judgment as to quality, value, authenticity, or similar matters. (2) If it is reasonable to do so, the recipient of an assertion of a person's opinion as to facts not disclosed and not otherwise known to the recipient may properly interpret it as an assertion (a) that the facts known to that person are not incompatible with his opinion, or (b) that he knows facts sufficient to justify him in forming it.

**§ 169 When Reliance on an Assertion of Opinion Is Not Justified** To the extent that an assertion is one of opinion only, the recipient is not justified in relying on it unless the recipient (a) stands in such a relation of trust and confidence to the person whose opinion is asserted that the recipient is reasonable in relying on it, or (b) reasonably believes that, as compared with himself, the person whose opinion is asserted has special skill, judgment or objectivity with respect to the subject matter, or (c) is for some other special reason particularly susceptible to a misrepresentation of the type involved.

**§ 171 When Reliance on an Assertion of Intention Is Not Justified** (1) To the extent that an assertion is one of intention only, the recipient is not justified in relying on it if in the circumstances a misrepresentation of intention is consistent with reasonable standards of dealing. (2) If it is reasonable to do so, the promisee may properly interpret a promise as an assertion that the promisor intends to perform the promise.

**§ 172 When Fault Makes Reliance Unjustified** A recipient's fault in not knowing or discovering the facts before making the contract does not make his reliance unjustified unless it amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing.

## Misunderstanding

Will not be on test

## Impracticability

**§ 261 Discharge by Supervening Impracticability** Where, after a contract is made, a party's performance is made impracticable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his duty to render that performance is discharged, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.

I: The question is whether the contract should be voided because of impracticability.

R: Under the Restatement Second, a contract can be voided due to impracticability is when events following contract formation are different from assumptions the parties made when the contract was made. Like Mistake, the doctrine of impracticability deals with situations where the exchange turned out very different from what was expected. Unlike mistake, with impracticability there was no factual error at the time of contracting. Instead, the supervening event happens after contracting. The older common law rule was impossibility, which contemplated a situation where an event completely defeated the ability to perform, such as when a person died or an object was destroyed. The scope of the doctrine has broadened to include situations where performance is technically possible but has become extremely burdensome.

For a duty to render performance to be discharged because of impracticability, four elements have to be satisfied. These elements are (1) an event must have occurred, the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract (§§ 262-264); (2) the event must have made performance impracticable (unduly burdensome – not impossible); (3) impracticability cannot be either party’s fault; and (4) the party seeking relief must not have assumed the risk.

A:

I: The first issue is whether an event whose non-occurrence was a basis on which the contract was made occurred.

R: Under the Restatement Second of Contracts, for performance of a contract to become impracticable, an event must have occurred, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract. This event (i) does not have to be unforeseeable; it is sufficient that it be unforeseen (not likely to occur) or unexpected; and (ii) the event must not have been foreseen as a real possibility. Examples of this kind of event are war, natural disaster, a strike, a change in the law, the death of a person, destruction of property, and perhaps a global pandemic.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, the element of the occurrence of an event is satisfied.

I: The second issue is whether the event made performance impracticable.

R: For an event to make performance impracticable, performance must have become unduly burdensome but not necessarily impossible, and the effort required to perform must be substantial, extreme, or very burdensome. The event must have not just sowed inconvenience, but must have made performance vitally different from what was anticipated.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, the element of performance having become impracticable is satisfied.

I: The third issue is whether either of the parties caused the event to become impracticable.

R: For an event to have made performance impracticable, the impracticability of performance cannot be either party’s fault.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, the element of fault is satisfied.

I: The fourth issue is whether either of the parties assumed the risk.

R: For an event to have made performance impracticable, neither party can have assumed the risk. To determine whether a party assumed risk, courts look for express language in the contract such as a force majeure clause, and may consider surrounding context and normal practices and expectations. Sometimes court will allocate risk to one party.

A: Here, ... (consider what would parties have bargained for had they anticipated the extraordinary event)

C: Therefore, the element of risk is satisfied.

C: Therefore, the contract should be voided because of impracticability because all of the elements of impracticability are satisfied.

---

## Unconscionability

I: The question is whether there was unconscionability where ...

R: For a court to find that there was unconscionability there must be an “absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party.” The two kinds of unfairness are procedural unfairness and substantive unfairness; the more there is of one the less is needed of the other. Generally, the doctrine calls for some of both. Courts are more inclined to find unconscionability where there is procedural unfairness than where there is substantive unfairness. Unconscionability is the only defense that looks at substantive fairness. Substantive unfairness is really unfairness of the terms. We saw that everything up until now courts will not look at the adequacy of consideration, because the more important principle is assent; if we're dealing with two parties with full capacity who look like they know what they're doing, the court doesn't care. It goes back to the presumption of neo-classical economic theory, and the court doesn't care if the terms are unfair. The court doesn't look at fairness. It looks for lack of assent. The doctrine of unconscionability is looking at really unfair terms. Really unfair terms are what trigger the doctrine. At the core unconsionability is about bad behavior. The core is not whether a person was sophisticated or educated enough to understand. It's about whether a person took advantage of it. If we change the way we think about defenses (especially unconscionability), can we take the focus off human frailties and inadequacies of the person seeking to avoid the contract and put the focus on the limits we must or should place on the use of power? If we did this all of these defenses would still work. But we would change the focus to the limits on the use of power.

A:

I: The first issue is whether there is procedural unfairness.

R: Procedural unfairness is unfairness is in the bargaining process (who took advantage of whom). In determining whether there was procedural unfairness, courts look at (i) status - who the parties are and what is the balance of power of the two parties (i.e. gross inequality of bargaining power), and (2) whether someone took advantage of the known disparity in bargaining power. Courts look at factors such as the relationship between the parties, wealth and financial insecurity, education levels of the parties, knowledge of subject matter, absence of meaningful choice, whether there is a monopoly (e.g., no choice of other sellers), whether the contract is an adhesion contract (a take it or leave it situation), whether the subject of the contract is a necessity item (no option to walk away), and the culture and/or language of the parties. In terms of behavior, a court may look at whether a party is taking advantage of known disparity in power; whether there are deceptive sales practices, such as rushing or pressure to sign; whether the parties have access to other advice or to a lawyer; fine print; convoluted terms; long sentences; legalese; or the burying of important information.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, there is/is not procedural unfairness.

I: The second issue is whether there is substantive unfairness.

R: Substantive unfairness is unfairness in the terms of the contract. To determine whether there is substantive unfairness, courts consider factors such as whether the contract is shockingly one-sided; whether the contract shocks the conscience of the court; and whether the contract is extreme in light of its commercial setting.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, there is/is not substantive unfairness.

C: Therefore, there is unconscionability because there is procedural unfairness and substantive unfaireness.

**3 Definitions of Unconscionability (look at other outline to see difference between RST and UCC)**

- UCC § 2-302 (and comment), RST § 208

- Williams v. Walker Thomas (this is THE landmark case for unconsionability) (U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. Circuit [1965]. Terms of a retail Purchase Agreement: "The amount of each periodic installment payment to be made by the [purchaser]  to the Company under this present lease shall be inclusive of and not in addition to the amount of each installment payment to be made by [purchaser] under such prior leases, bills or accounts; and all payments now and hereafter made by [purchaser] shall be credited pro rata on all outstanding leases, bills and accounts due the Company by [purchaser] at the time each such payment is made.")

Involves changed circumstances – parties want to change the terms of their contract. With impracticability, circumstances materially change after the parties sign the contract so court excuses performance. Here, change in circumstances might not be material enough to excuse performance (original contract may still be enforceable), but parties want to modify terms.The next issue is whether modification of the contract will be allowed.

**§ 89 Modification of Executory Contract** A promise modifying a duty under a contract not fully performed on either side is binding (a) if the modification is fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the contract was made; or (b) to the extent provided by statute; or (c) to the extent that justice requires enforcement in view of material change of position in reliance on the promise.

Prof Z reply to Leora's question in forum: 1. If there's a question where one party is claiming that the contract was modified, then the second IRAC would be a parol evidence rule IRAC (which could be really short). It would basically need to say that under one of the exceptions, the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence to prove a modification (so the evidence would be admissible).

In Nanakuli, the evidence did not modify the contract -- the extrinsic evidence in that case was TU and CP evidence which the court considered to be (an implied) part of the contract when signed, not a modification of the signed contract.

I promise to sell you my bike for $100

Then I get an offer for $150.
We both agree I’ll sell you the bike for $130 instead.

Valid modification?
Why would you agree to that?
Is there consideration for the modification?

---

**Pre-Existing Duty Rule**

A promise to do something you’re already obligated to do can’t be sufficient consideration for a return promise.

some modifications in good faith, others in bad. if in bad faith covered by duress and k not enforceable.

this bike sale would fall under ucc because sale of goods.

ucc wanted to make the code more flexible. these are the legal realists saying you know, sometimes people make mistakes, miscalculate. see ucc numbers below.

used to be that a modification was not valid without something new being exchanged (watch recording just before break at 7:06 because phone rang and this was interesting)

there used to be no duress

Now

New rules take into account good faith reasons to modify

**UCC § 2-209:** An agreement modifying a contract needs no consideration to be valid.  Just need: signed writing and mutual assent (No reason for modification needed)

**RST § 89:** Generally, still need consideration unless (need all of the following): Good faith / voluntary; Unexpected change in circumstances (reason for modification) **something must have happened that must have made the contract impracticable**; Signed writing; Mutual assent

When looking at modification cases, look first for consideration. if there's consideration the modification will be valid and there will be no need for further analysis. If no consideration and it's movable goods, if there's a signed writing and mutual assent, the modification is valid.

Alaska Packers (p 512)

Fishers agreed to work on a fishing boat in Alaska for $60/season plus 2 cents per salmon
Part way through the season they demanded $100 or they’d stop work entirely.
		(What does this fact trigger?) - **economic duress**
Alaska Packers agreed (WHY?) - **they need fish - they need the labor, the season is short, no one else to do the labor - economic duress is i did not want to give in but i had no choice; my assent is compromised; economic duress**
The season ended and the fishers demanded their $100. Alaska packers denied the validity of the new K.  

was there consideration here?

what did the workers allege was the consideration? **the nets**

the court said there was no consideration because they were agreeing to do something they had a preexisting obligation to do under the first contract.

the workers said yeah but when we agreed to do the work we expected the nets to be functional and the nets were faulty so we had to work twice as hard. the faulty nets made it much harder to work so they asked for more money per fish

the court said no evidence.

the court's reasoning is that is was not beneficial for the company to have faulty nets - it's in everybody's interest that the nets not be faulty -

unfair labor conditions

just because they don't want faulty nets doesn't mean that they didn't provide faulty nets.

here the court sided with the company and assumed the workers had more bargaining power which is very uncommon and ridiculous

---

this is not a sale of goods so we have to use the rst.

the takeaway from this case is you cant make a modification based on economic duress

this case is consistent with the neo classical economic theory in that the court is assuming equality of bargaining power which is so rare. to assume equal bargaining power here seems quite wrong. something that should be challenged in this case. whats another reading of this case. another fair wage fair labor dispute - they got lower wages because of faulty equipment. because they were so isolated a lot of the same things applied to the fishers as to the alaska packers. the fishers themselves were in a very precarious position because they were relying on this job for the season.

Quigley (p 518)

Quigley sold farm to Wilsons
Wilsons assigned K to Hatfield who couldn’t make payments
Wilsons couldn’t make the payments either
How did they modify the K?
What happened? Who complained about the modification?

---

Was there consideration for the modification?
Is consideration required?
Historically: Yes
UCC 2-209: No
Non sale of goods (RST)?

Quigley was elderly and he lived in a home and the sons said he was feeble minded

---

the court said there was no consideration - ? - there was some talk about waiver
---

**big thing here is that the code requires no consideration**

---

Examples of changed circumstances

Not just absence of coercion – need to show some reason (unanticipated circumstances):

Market fluctuations
Performance becomes more difficult
Lack of availability of goods
etc

---

Why did quigley agree to modify the contract so substantially?

good faith, generosity, niceness caring

but it could be that even if quigley is acting out of profit motive, he made the calculation that the other party is going to default anyway, so it's better to modify and accept the modified circumstances

---

substantive fairness is not required for a modification, but the court is looking for a reason to modify, but if you can show fairness that can be a good reason to modify. it's substantively different but ... the court also said it was voluntary but the question does come up as to quigley's capacity - court said fair because quigley had a lawyer, and usually if there's a lawyer you cant say no capacity

## Interpretation

Implied terms

Interpretation: Implied terms

Most big thing in contract law is interpretation of terms.

Rules of interpretation - including the parol evidence rule - try to lay out how much information goes to the court, so that the intent doesn't get lost in a sea of information.

Historically, in terms of contract interpretation before the ucc, you really needed a lot of terms in the writing to make it a contract. didn't want the courts to tell us what was fair - contract law is very much private law - historically if too many terms were missing and the terms were unclear or vague, the contract would be unenforceable. in the past, the courts would simply not enforce it; sometimes the parties wanted to enforce the contract but the court wouldn't;

the legal realists wanted to make things less rigid and more flexible and they created the idea of ... and introducing extrinsic evidence

extrinsic evidence is evidence outside of the four corners of the document

other evidence can be conversations, other documents, experts getting on the stand and explaining, other things explaining, clarifying...

fill in the gaps means figure out what the parties intended when this is not clear in the document.

with contract interpretation the goal is to get at the intent of the parties. the goal is not to fill in the gaps with things that are fair or the most common usages. when you are looking for intent and the parties are silent we look to the industry for common

the court is not trying to fill  in the gaps with the terms that are most reasonable. rather the court is trying to fill in the gaps with what the parties intended.

Parties do not have to follow customs; if they don't want to follow customs, what should they do? write it clearly in the contract. Specify it.

Interpretation: Implied terms

UCC’s expanded definition of agreement:

The bargain of the parties as found in their language or (should be and! says prof z) by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance.

Terms implied in every contract

if there is evidence of trade usage and it is admissable, it becomes a term of the contract like any other term. so therefore if you have evidence of ... and the court finds that its admissable, you can breach.

- Trade usage: § 1-303(c):

- Custom in the industry

if delivery always happen on fridays and it has been happening for a long time, it is admissable so it becomes a term of the contract. (if half the people say delivery on monday and other half say delivery on friday, there is no custom )

Look at established practices in industry and in locale.  **Regularity of observance.**

- Issue: How do you define the trade?

---

Terms implied in every contract

Course of dealing: § 1-303(b):

How have parties dealt with each other in the past – look at prior contracts between same parties.

now we have a k between z and lm - we look at all of their past contracts; how have they agreed on contracting in the past; this is their private custom; because we have always done this in the past, it is fair to assume that the delivery will happen on Friday.

---

Terms implied in every contract

Course of performance: § 1-303(a)

- How have the parties dealt with each other during the performance of this contract? (e.g., installment contracts, where there are repeated occasions for performance)

- Look at actions of the parties in carrying out the contract at issue.

---

Terms implied in every contract

Implied obligations of good faith and best efforts (people do expect each other to act in good faith - we assume that we will so we just write that down)

Emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with justified expectations of the other party

When one party has discretion, there’s an implied obligation to use reasonable efforts in light of their ability / means / expectations – can’t act arbitrarily or 	irrationally (We saw this with contracts that appear to be illusory)

Nanakuli

What’s the alleged breach?  What term?

Nanakuli is the second largest asphalt paving contractor in hawaii. buying all the asphalt needs from shell. ongoing contract from 1963 to year. case is in year.

nanakuli brings a suit for breach of contract. nanakuli is saying that shell breached price protection. was price protection a term of the contract. Yes. it was an implied term.

Nanakuli is suing shell for breach of the term of the contract that says it will price protect. Shell says there is no term for price protect - we never promised that - nanakuli says yes you did - its Implied

nanakuli is buying asphalt at the price that shell has posted at the time of delivery.

oil embargo happened in 70s. shell raises prices drastically. nanakuli says based on your price we already committed to posted price. you should raise price after delivery.

if you read contract very closely you can argue that shell

---

Price protection

Requires Shell to hold the price on the tonnage Nanakuli had already committed – Nanakuli had already incorporated that price into bids put out

Express term vs Implied terms

What was the relevant express term?

What extrinsic evidence was offered to prove the implied term was part of the contract?

Trade usage

What does Nanakuli argue was the custom?

---

How do you define the trade?

Shell argues that when you look just at the asphalt trade there is no evidence of the custom of price protection because in the asphalt train the only sellers are shell and chevron, which price protects but thats irrelevant because chevron owns paving companies it deals with.

shell argues that you should look at the narrow trade

Nanakuli is saying that it is common in the industry to price protect, but nanakuli is looking at the paving industry which is larger than the oil industry.

nanakuli argues that you should look at the broader trade

court says that in this particular case you look at the locale as well as the industry

Defining Trade

Look at the practice in the particular trade AND in the particular locality

Businesses can be held to more general business practices to the extent of actual knowledge of those practices

Course of Performance

Nanakuli argues that Shell price protected Nanakuli in 1970 and again in 1971.

What was Shell’s problem with that argument?

---

Does extrinsic evidence contradict the written contract?

Express term: “Shell’s posted price at the time of delivery”
Extrinsic evidence (Implied term): Price protection
Does it contradict?
Can you read price protection as consistent with the express term?

---

Nanakuli: Rule

Extrinsic evidence (TU, CD, CP) (trade usage, course of delivery, course of performance) can’t contradict the written contract.
Can supplement the written agreement or modify it
Just can’t totally negate it.
K term must retain some meaning

look at video again at 7:29 pm -

youre trying to show that the constract is - what it means - yeah posted time at time of delivery means all the time except when...

---

Example where trade usage totally negates the express term

TU: Price protection
Express term: We agree not to price protect

---

Nanakuli decided from Legal Realist perspective (as opposed to a Formalist perspective)

Consider context. Don’t rigidly or narrowly interpret a contract according to words alone.

Look beyond the “four corners of the document” (the printed pages of the contract) to common usages, understandings, and expectations.

- Clear on face, but party claims other meaning

---

Ambiguous syntax

vague just means too broadly defined like it was green but what shade of green

ambiguous means that the words can be interpreted in two or more different ways

---

Approaches to interpretation

Subjective
Objective
Formalist
Contextual

---

Formalist Approach

Words CAN have set meanings independent of particular contexts

(formalists don't believe that words always have set meanings but believe that they can have clear meanings - so extrinsic evidence is not admissable when the terms are clear and unambiguous)

Plain meaning rule:  No need to look beyond the text (“4 corners of the document”) when the terms are clear.

Extrinsic evidence (evidence outside the 4 corners) is not admissible when the terms are clear and unambiguous.

---

Contextualist Approach

Words have meaning only in context (impossible to read words on a page in a vacuum and know what they mean - you have to look outside; you need to know the trade usage, the custom, the shared meanings)

In interpreting words, courts should look at:

Other extrinsic evidence like:

Writings
Oral statements
Implied terms like:
TU, CD, CP
Extrinsic evidence is admissible even if the contract terms seem clear on their face

Pacific Gas (p 594) **(really good example of the contextualist approach)** d was doing work on p's stuff and damages some of p's stuff (turbine). p repairs and then says d owes them money to indemnify p against all loss resulting from injury to property ... from the contract. D agreed to indemnify P against: “all loss ... resulting from injury to property in connection with performance of the K.” Did this case involve loss resulting from injury to property? yes. Why doesn’t D think they have to pay? D says there was loss to property but that's not what we meant. we meant all loss resulting in injury to all third party property in connection with performance of the K." Trial court takes formalist approach. Plain meaning of clause is you have to pay. Supreme court takes a contextualist approach. Introduces extrinsic evidence. Does the language of the contract have to be ambiguous to justify considering extrinsic evidence? No it does not. There is the key. If the language of the contract is clear on its face like in this case, the formalists will not introduce extrinsic evidence, but the contextualist court will allow extrinsic evidence which may have other interpretations within the industry. On the other hand, if the language in the contract is vague or ambiguous, both the formalist and contextualist courts will allow extrinsic evidence.  


---

# PER

Default is that evidence of prior statements leading up to the K is not admissible.

Based on assumption everything the parties agreed to prior to signing the K is embodied in the written agreement.

Gives integrity and weight to the written contract.

PER says when such evidence is admissible

PER § 2-202, RST § 215, 216
•	Terms in writing
–	May not be contradicted
–	But may be supplemented or explained by
– TU, CD, CP
– Consistent Additional Terms, UNLESS the K was fully integrated

Integration
•	Partial integration: Document is final as to what’s written but not complete



•	Full integration: Document is complete and final expression of the parties’ agreement

•	If partially integrated: Consistent add’l terms are admissible
•	If fully integrated: Consistent add’l terms are not admissible

Parts of rule restated differently
•	Extrinsic evidence can never contradict the K (but can partially negate a term – see
Nanakuli)

•	TU, CD, CP are always admissible unless they contradict the K

•	Consistent additional terms are never admissible unless the K is not fully integrated

Exceptions
•	Extrinsic evidence is always admissible to explain or interpret a term when that term is ambiguous or unclear

•	PER doesn’t apply to modifications or subsequent agreements

•	PER doesn’t exclude evidence to establish a defense to K formation

Betaco (p 570)
•	What was the alleged breach?

Betaco (p 570)
•	Alleged express warranty: “The new Citation Jet is much faster, more efficient and has more range than the Citation I”
•	Is there any dispute that the cover letter said that?
•	Did the Citation Jet have greater range than the Citation 1?
•	Then what’s the issue?

Issue
•	Is extrinsic evidence (cover letter) admissible to interpret the purchase agreement?

•	Go through each step of the rule…

Sub-Issues
•	Does the extrinsic evidence contradict the contract?

•	Is it evidence of TU, CD, or CP?

•	Is it a consistent additional term?

•	Was the contract fully integrated?
(How will court determine whether the K is fully integrated?)

How will court determine whether the K is fully integrated?
•	Look at intention of parties (through their words and actions)

•	Look first for merger clause
–	Is the merger clause valid?
•	Then look for other circumstances surrounding the transaction

Merger clause (or Integration clause)

•	Clause stating the parties intend the signed contract to be a complete and final statement of their agreement.

•	Example (Betaco): “This is the only agreement controlling this purchase.”

stronger merger clause would say this is the only agreement controlling this purchase and this clause is final.

So…
•	If the contract is fully integrated, where does that leave us? Is that the end of the analysis?

---

betaco steps of analysis (they are actually above)

the issue is whether the cover letter was really part of the k

1. does the extrinsic evidence contradict the contract? no - sort of does but not really because it isn't

2. is the extrinsic evidence (the cover letter) trade usage (custom and practice), course of dealing (prior contracts), course of performance ? None of these because it lacks regularity of performance

does the extrinsic evidence supplement the K?

betaco is saying that we agreed to all the terms in the k and we also agreed w the terms in the cover letter. additional term. admissable unless k fully integrated.

---
## Interpretation Steps of Analysis

Any time there’s an interpretation question:

### Is there an express term to interpret?

- If so, follow the framework for express terms
- PER: Evidence is always admissible to interpret an express term (exception to PER)
- *Sometimes you need implied terms to interpret an express term!*

### If there is no express term

- Follow the framework for interpreting implied terms
- Is someone trying to introduce extrinsic evidence of additional terms of the contract?
- Is it TU, CD, CP (implied terms)? (**Always admissible as long as it doesn’t contradict the contract**)
- Is it some other kind of evidence (conversation, other writing…)? (**Only admissible if contract is not fully integrated**)

# Breach aka substantial performance

I: When addressing a contract dispute, the first question a court needs to ask is whether the contract involved the sale of movable goods, services, construction, property, or something else.

R: This is because depending on what the contract is for, different laws apply. Contracts for the sale of movable goods over $500 are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), while pretty much everything else is governed by common law as codified into the Restatement Second of Contracts (RST).

A: The contract in question here is a contract for ... , which is a ....   

C: Therefore, the UCC/RST applies.

Here there are two questions. (1) and (2). First, I will discuss ... , and second, I will discuss damages.

I: The first question is whether both parties performed as the terms of the contract required.

R: Courts allow parties to breach contracts because forcing them to remain in a contract they no longer want to be in would amount to forcing them into involuntary servitude. When one party says the other party breached by not performing as the terms of the contract required, and the other party says that there wasn’t a breach, to determine whether there was a breach, courts interpret the contract to see whether any terms of the contract were breached.

A:

## Interpretation

Historically, in terms of contract interpretation before the UCC, you really needed a lot of terms in the writing to make something a contract. If too many terms were missing and the terms were unclear or vague, the contract would be unenforceable. In the past, the courts would simply not enforce it; sometimes the parties wanted to enforce a contract but the court wouldn’t. The legal realists wanted to make things less rigid and more flexible and they created the idea of creating a framework for introducing extrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence is evidence outside of the four corners of the document. It can be conversations, other documents, experts getting on the stand and explaining, other things explaining and clarifying what the parties intended when this is not clear in the document. With contract interpretation the goal is to get at the intent of the parties. The goal is not to fill in the gaps with things that are fair or the most common usages.

**IF EXPRESS TERMS**

I: The first sub issue is what term or clause is at issue.

R: The terms of an agreement can be in express or implied terms. Express terms are terms that were specifically mentioned and agreed upon by both parties at the time the contract is made, either orally or in writing. Implied terms are terms not written in the contract but may be admissible by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance.

A: Here, there were ... terms in writing where ...

C: Therefore, the court would interpret ... terms.

**IF IMPLIED TERMS**

I: The first sub issue is what term or clause is at issue.

R: The terms of an agreement can be in express or implied terms. Express terms are terms that were specifically mentioned and agreed upon by both parties at the time the contract is made, either orally or in writing. Implied terms are terms not written in the contract but may be admissible by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance. Every contract also implies obligations of good faith and best efforts. These obligations emphasize faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with justified expectations of the other party. When one party has discretion, there’s an implied obligation to use reasonable efforts in light of their ability, means or expectations not to act arbitrarily or irrationally.

A: Here, the contract is silent as to the question of trade usage that ... is trying to introduce.

C: Therefore, the term at issue is an implied term.

**UCC and RST implied terms rules in case I want to use:** The UCC integrates implied terms into its expanded definition of every agreement. By this definition, an agreement is "The bargain of the parties as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance." The Restatement Second defines implied terms as terms that must be inferred from the conduct of the parties, and a contract with implied terms one which often involves a course of dealing between the parties or a common trade usage.

I: The second sub-issue is whether the terms are clear and unambiguous.

R: When terms are ambiguous or unclear, specific provisions generally control over general provisions, but courts will favor interpretations that give meaning to the whole contract, because it results in a fairer bargain. When a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intent of the parties still leaves contractual terms fairly susceptible to at least two rational interpretations, extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of these meanings is admissible.

A: Here, the breaching party would argue that... The non-breaching party would argue that ... The court would likely find that ...  breached.

C: Therefore, extrinsic evidence is admissible because the terms are unclear.

---

I: The next sub-issue is whether the evidence is evidence of trade usage.

R: Trade usage is any practice having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade, as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. To determine whether evidence is trade usage, courts look at established practices in the industry and in locale. Regularity of observance helps to establish a practice. An issue that comes up when determining whether evidence is evidence of trade usage is how to define a trade. To define a trade, courts look at the practice in the particular trade AND in the particular locality. If there is evidence of trade usage and it is admissible, it becomes a term of the contract like any other term. *Therefore, if you have evidence of trade usage and the court finds that it is admissible, you can enforce the term.*

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

I: The next sub-issue is whether the evidence that ... wants to introduce is evidence of course of dealing.

R: Under the UCC, course of dealing is the way in which parties have dealt with each other in the past. To see whether there was course of dealing, courts look at prior contracts between the same parties.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

I: The next sub-issue is whether the evidence shows course of performance.

R: To determine whether evidence shows course of performance, courts look at how the parties have dealt with each other during the performance of the contract in question. This is particularly done with installment contracts, where there are repeated occasions for performance. Courts look specifically at the actions of the parties in carrying out the contract at issue.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

I: The next sub-issue is whether there was good faith and best efforts.

R: Under Restatement Second of Contracts, neither party shall do anything that will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract. This means that one party cannot (1) prevent the other party from performing, nor (2) exercise discretion under the contract to hurt the other party. There must be (3) faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and (4) consistency with justified expectations of the other party. where a contract contemplates the exercise of discretion, the party shall not act arbitrarily or irrationally in exercising that discretion. This duty to use good faith and best efforts reflects social norms which people should normally indend to comply with.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

**Whether evidence admissible**

I: The next issue is whether the evidence is admissible.

R: A formalist approach to the interpretation of contracts does not admit extrinsic evidence when the terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous. This approach assumes that words can have set meanings independent of particular contexts. By the plain meaning rule, formalist courts do their best to stick only to terms which are within the "four corners" of the document. A contextualist - or legal realist - approach looks outside the four corners of the document and admits extrinsic evidence even if the contract terms seem clear on their face. Contextualists assume that words have meaning only in context. Therefore, when interpreting words a contextualist court looks at other extrinsic evidence such as writings, oral statements, and implied terms such as trade usage, course of dealings and course of performance. In Nanakuli, which was decided from a legal realist perspective, the court looked beyond the four corners of the document to common usages, understandings, and expectations. Extrinsic evidence is never admissible if it contradicts the contract, but it can supplement a contract or modify it.

A: Here, ... does not contradict... because ... A formalist court would ... and a contextualist court would ... (Under either approach, terms are probably vague and both approaches would consider extrinsic evidence to explain. PER: Implied terms like TU, CD, or CP would be admissible to explain. Depends on what the evidence is. Is there a custom surrounding these terms?)

C: Therefore, ...

I: The next issue is whether extrinsic evidence is admissible under the Parol Evidence Rule.

R: Under the Parol Evidence Rule, terms in writing may not be contradicted but may be supplemented or explained by trade usage, course of delivery or course of performance. Consistent additional terms are admissible if the contract is partially integrated (the document is final as to what is written but not complete) but are not admissible if the contract is fully integrated. A contract is fully integrated where the document is the complete and final expression of the parties’ agreement. The assumption is that everything the parties agreed to prior to signing the contract is embodied in the written agreement, as this gives integrity and weight to the written contract. Exceptions to the parol evidence rule are (1) extrinsic evidence is always admissible to explain or interpret a term when that term is ambiguous or unclear; (2) the parol evidence rule does not apply to modifications or subsequent agreements; and (3) the parol evidence rule does not exclude evidence to establish a defense to contract formation.

A:

I: The first sub-issue is whether the contract is fully integrated.

R: Courts determine whether a contract is fully integrated by looking at the intention of the parties through their words and actions, and whether there is a valid merger clause. A merger clause is a clause stating that the parties intend the signed contract to be a complete and final statement of their agreement.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, the contract is fully integrated.

## Parol Evidence Rule

I: The next sub-issue is whether any of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule apply.

R: Exceptions to the parol evidence rule are (1) extrinsic evidence is always admissible to explain or interpret a term when that term is ambiguous or unclear; (2) the parol evidence rule does not apply to modifications or subsequent agreements; and (3) the parol evidence rule does not exclude evidence to establish a defense to contract formation.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, the evidence of ... is admissible because it is trade usage, supplements or explains the terms in writing, and is not an additional term.

C: Therefore, the court should admit extrinsic evidence of ... as part of ...

C: Therefore, there was/was not a breach where ...

---

**Constructive conditions rule**

R: When performance can be exchanged simultaneously, promises must be performed simultaneously (the presumption is that promises are dependent). These are constructive conditions.

**Substantial performance rule**

R: When performance cannot be rendered at the same time, as is the case with employment or service contracts that take time to complete, performance requiring a longer period of time must be rendered first. This is called substantial performance. The doctrine of substantial performance gives some protection to the person who has to perform first, because they have more to lose. Substantial performance usually involves construction or service contracts, but never the sale of goods. In the event that there has been substantial performance by one party, (1) performance by the other party is due, and (2) damages are diminution/difference in value as opposed to cost of completion (I will discuss damages later).

A: Here, the contract is for ... so ...

C: Therefore, this contract requires substantial performance.

I: The next sub-issue is whether one of the parties breached by failing to substantially perform.

R: To determine whether one of the parties breached by failing to substantially perform, courts consider (i) whether there was harm to the injured party; (ii) whether there was harm to the breaching party; and (iii) whether the failure to substantially perform was the fault of the breaching party.

A:

I: The first question is whether there was harm to the injured party.

R: Courts calculate harm to the injured party by looking at the extent of non-performance and the extent to which the injured party received the benefit it expected from the bargain. Deficiency cannot be so substantial as to frustrate the purpose of the contract.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

I: The second question is whether there was harm to the breaching party.

R: When measuring harm to the breaching party, courts consider various factors including (a) the extent of forfeiture the party in breach will suffer if the court finds no substantial performance and they have to redo the work already done, (b) the cruelty of enforcing strict adherence, (c) the cost of curing a deficiency, and (d) economic waste.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

I: The third question is whether the failure to substantially perform was the fault of the breaching party.

R: To determine what remedies are appropriate in cases where a party breached by performing substantially less than the contract required, courts examine (a) whether the breach was willful or made in bad faith and (b) the breaching party's excuse for deviating from the letter of the contract. Negligence is generally a justified reason for breaching, and even a conscious departure from contract specifications will not always be found to be the breaching party's fault. The breaching party is most likely to be found to be at fault when they breached because they intentionally tried to cut corners.

A: Here, ...

C: Therefore, ...

**Perfect Tender Rule for goods**

I: The first question is whether both parties performed as the terms of the contract required.

R: Under the Uniform Commercial Code § 2-601, the Perfect Tender Rule requires that parties to a contract involving the sale of goods exercise strict compliance with the terms of the contract. If the goods fail to conform to the contract in any respect (even if minor), the buyer can reject the goods. The Perfect Tender Rule is harsher than common law because unlike Substantial Performance, there is not the same need to protect a party who has to perform first.

A: Here, the contract is for ... so ...

C: Therefore, this contract is governed by the Perfect Tender Rule.

**Specific Performance rule**

R: The remedy of specific performance, which is an injunction for the breaching party to perform the actual contractual obligation, is an exceptional remedy available only when monetary damages would be inadequate, and which the court would not use here because here monetary damages would suffice.

---

## Damages

I: Assuming that the court finds that ... breached the contract with ... to provide ... the next question is what remedy the court should apply.

R: For a court to assign damages, the damages need to be foreseeable and proved to a reasonable certainty, and the loss must arise naturally from breach or reasonably be in the contemplation of the parties. The non-breaching party must prove a causal connection with reasonable certainty between the loss or damages caused by the breach. The causal connection cannot be too remote or theoretical. Limitations on damages are (i) Certainty (reasonable), (ii) Foreseeability, (iii) Mitigation.  Certainty should amount to a reasonable certainty not mathematical precision and the yardstick is estimated from standard or similar business in that area, including profit history. Damages are not to punish a party for breaching but to compensate the other party for their loss. Courts use three theories for measuring money damages. These are expectation, reliance and restitution. The choice of which measure of damages is within the court’s discretion, but there are guidelines. The starting point is courts always want to award damages whenever they can, because that is supposed to mirror exactly what happened if the contract had not been breached.

Expectation damages and reliance damages are forward looking because they are trying to put the parties in the position they would have been in had the contract not been breached. Expectation is the goal and usually awarded. However, a court is likely to award reliance damages when the contract is too speculative for expectation damages. A court is likely to award restitution damages when there's no contract or if the contract is unenforceable. Another kind of damages are non-pecuniary damages (Pain and suffering). These are generally not recoverable because they are hard to measure.

**Damages rules to tack on to general damages rule:**

**Construction contracts damages rule**

R: For breach of a construction contract, the injured party may generally recover all damages that are direct, natural, and immediate consequences of the breach and were reasonably within the parties' contemplation at the time they entered the contract. If the contractor fails to perform or incompletely performs, damages should be measured by the reasonable cost of replacement or completion [cutting corners-did not grade land below surface].

I: The first issue is how damages for breach should be calculated.

R: The three theories of contract damages which courts use to calculate damages are the expectation theory, the reliance theory and the restitution theory.

A:

I: The first question is how much damages Buyer would be entitled to under the Expectation theory.

R: The expectation theory of contract damages aims to put the plaintiff in as good a position as she would have been in had the contract been performed. When applying the expectation theory, courts calculate …

A: Here,

C: Therefore, Buyer would be entitled to … under the expectation theory.

I: The second question is how much damages Buyer would be entitled to under the reliance theory.

R: The reliance theory of contract damages aims to put the plaintiff back in the position she would have been in had there been no contract (the plaintiff gets back all expenses incurred in reliance on the contract). When applying the expectation theory, courts calculate …

A: Here,

C: Therefore, Buyer would be entitled to … under the reliance theory.

I: The third question is how much damages Buyer would be entitled to under the restitution theory.

R: The restitution theory of contract damages aims to prevent unjust enrichment by putting the defendant back in the position he would have been in had there been no contract (plaintiff gets back all benefits conferred on defendant). When applying the restitution theory, courts calculate …

A: Here,

C: Therefore, Buyer would be entitled to … under the restitution theory.

C: Therefore, Buyer would be entitled to … damages under the expectation theory, … damages under the reliance theory, and … damages under the restitution theory. A court would likely grant … damages under the expectation theory because the expectation theory is generally what courts prefer.

## Measuring Expectation

| Net benefit expected (expected profit) (expectation) | + | All costs actually incurred |

| What I expected to get out of the K | + | What I ended up spending |

| Revenues expected minus expected cost of performance (equivalent to profit expected) | + | Anticipated costs incurred plus unanticipated costs incurred (lost profits are cost incurred)|

**Buyer's damages:**

Market value - K price - other costs of performance

**Seller's damages:**

K price - market price - other costs of performance

**Builder's damages:**

K price - cost of performance

Anticipated = cost of performance actually incurred

Unanticipated = breach-related costs actually incurred

---

## Measuring Reliance Damages

| Expected costs incurred | + | Unexpected costs incurred |

| (costs incurred because of promise) (expected costs of performing the K[ breach must have rendered those expenditures valueless]) | ... | (costs incurred because of breach) (unexpected consequential or incidental loss [losses must have been foreseeable]) (consequential and incidental damages are breach-related costs) |

---

## Measuring Expectation in Construction Contracts

| Expected profit | + | Costs incurred |

| (level of improvement in well being) | ... | ,,, |

| (what you expected to get minus what you got) | ... | ,,, |

| (how much did you fall short of anticipated improvement or profit?) | ... | ,,, |

Expectation element (when builder breaches) = value of performance (expected) - value received  

**Two different ways to figure value:**

1. Diminution in value (using market value); market value expected minus market value received (*used when substantial performance*)
2. Cost of completion (*used when no substantial performance*)

---

**RULE:**  

Specific performance

- Injunction ordering the defendant to perform the actual contractual obligation

- Exceptional remedy (maybe the landlord )

- Available only when monetary damages would be inadequate

---

Why exceptional remedy?

- Policy against involuntary servitude
- Efficient breach

Money is supposed to compensate non- breaching party, and usually does.

Always argue policy! *always include policy in your argument*

**Policy against involuntary servitude:** Maybe owner wants to live in apartment. court doesn't want to force owner to not live there. nor does court want to force renter to live anywhere. so the remedy is money damages. Money is usually able to compensate for loss of something. but sometimes it isn't. hierloom, attachment.

---

**RULE:**

How do you show money damages would be inadequate?

- Goods/services are unique - no established market for them (money can’t buy substitute)

*can money buy you a substitute apartment? Can tenant move in somewhere else that would be a substitute apartment?* Maybe. right now we are just looking at whether the apartment is unique or can be substituted. Historically, land has been considered unique. typically and historically a sale of land or house is considered unique.

- Subject of contract involves matters of taste or sentiment (money can’t buy substitute)

- Consider difficulty of proving expectation damages with reasonable certainty

---

In Sullivan, one of the things she's asking for is non-pecuniary damages for pain and suffering. These are generally not recoverable (hard to measure) unless the contract involves non-pecuniary values. if k involves subject matter that is expected to be emotional. you have to look at k and ask if its foreseeable that k will lead to emotional harm. the typical sale of goods does not involve non-pecuniary damages. Are non-pecuniary damages recoverable in Sullivan? yes. Sullivan involves surgery and physical appearance and these are the kinds of things that involve physical pain and emotional pain and suffering. You have to make the case based on the facts that the case involves emotional values

**Where does emotional pain appear in the formula? costs incurred. in sullivan case unanticipated and anticipated -**

---

## Punitive damages

- Generally not recoverable
- Based on notions of efficient breach:
- Breaching party may gain more from breaching
- Non-breaching party is compensated through damages
- Society better off when goods are used in their most productive manner
- Punitive damages could encourage performance in cases where breach is more socially desirable

Hypo where prof Z rents apartment for a year and then decides to go to california. punishing prof Z for breaching does not make sense. prof z will be better off in california. prof z will have to compensate landlord - prof z will be better off by breaching.

Look at the non breaching party. are they better off? probably not. prof z is paying damages. months where apartment unrented - difference in amount if you rent it for a lower rent. you might be better off; you might get a new tenant who pays more. if you're better off, (I'm better off if i move; you're better off if you rent it for more money)

Only awarded where Egregious behavior (malice / willfulness/ recklessness…) or fraudulent conduct. When conduct is motivated by malicious intent or callous indifference to the right of others.

•	Not enough that the beach is “intentional”

•	Policy is not to deter breach, but to deter morally culpable conduct

damages may be awarded

Common example where punitive damages may be awarded

•	Violation of the Civil Rights Act

---

When arguing expectations. Plug in all costs incurred in equation.

all costs incurred. All

then perform analysis. look at limitations. nose in sullivan case. she said she would feel better. yes but can you calculate that with reasonable certainty. no. so that's a limitation.

if rain comes in because of hole in ceiling - is it foreseeable that carpet gets damaged? yes. is it foreseeable that the birds would come in? yes. it is foreseeable that i have a priceless picasso? maybe not. this has to be foreseeable to the breaching party. breaching party has to know that there might be a priceless picasso. is it foreseeable that i lose my job because of the hole in the ceiling? probably not.

---

limitations

court wont compensate injured party for:

loss he could have reasonably avoided (mitigation) ...

Halliburton -

PROF Z IS GOING TO POST NEW SLIDES - THESE ARE NOT THE RIGHT SLIDES

---

Limitations

Court won’t compensate injured party for:

Loss he could have reasonably avoided (mitigation) (§ 350)
Damages the breaching party did not have reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach at the time of contracting (§ 351)
Damages that can not be proved with reasonable certainty (§ 352)

---

"Lost profits" go under costs incurred

lost profits must be reasonably certain and foreseeable

---

Halliburton (Certainty)

Buyer claims if the goods had been as warranted, they would have bought four more additional systems, entered the containerized cargo business, and made $24 million.
Buyer seeking to recover those lost profits
Where do lost profits fall on the equation?
To recover lost profits they must be reasonably certain (and foreseeable…) [foreseeable is in parenthesis because in Halliburton case not about foreseeability but could have been]

**you have to be reasonably certain that the damages were caused by a breach.**

If you're arguing for the damages it doesn't have to be 100 percent precise. mathematical precision not required. if you're arguing against damages you say yeah you don't have to have mathematical precision but you don't even have reasonable certainty  

---

lost profits are tricky because ...

courts don't mind giving lost profits for lost business but they don't like to give lost profits for new businesses (they want to base a prediction on some data from the past - doesn't have to be mathematically precise - must be a yard stick)

---

damages

start with three theories

goal is ... WATCH START OF VIDEO

- expectation (net benefit plus cost incurred) (look at the big picture and take all of the amounts the plaintiff is asking for, plug everything in, and then talk about whether any limitations apply to each of the numbers I plugged in - sometimes you cant plug in a number because i can't quantify some cost incurred - do analysis and say damages might not be awarded because i can't count them)


---


Example 1
I have a bike worth $90
I contract to sell it to you for $110
I will have to pay $10 transportation costs to get it to you You breach before the bike is delivered
I have the bike stored in a storage locker and must pay $10 for one day

What are my expectation damages? What are my restitution damages?
What are my reliance damages?

net benefit 10 + costs incurred 10 for storage locker = 20

i expected to be 10 better off but i had to spend 10 on storage locker out of pocket

RESTITUTION IS ONLY THE BENEFIT RECEIVED BY THE OTHER PARTY - IF THE OTHER PARTY DIDN'T GET A BENEFIT (I NEVER GAVE THEM 10) - THERE IS NO RESTITUTION

Reliance is what I had to pay because of the breach.

class 4-22-21

WATCH OUT BECAUSE PPT SLIDES HEADINGS DID NOT COPY SO GO BACK TO

Example 2
Builder contracts with Owner to construct a factory Builder will be paid $1 million upon completion Owner breaches
Builder already spent $500,000
Would cost $400,000 to complete the job What are Builder’s expectation damages? What are Builder’s restitution damages?
What are Builder’s reliance damages?

Example 3
You contract to build me a fence You expect to get paid $100
Your total cost of performance is expected to be $80
You already spent $10 on materials I breach (before you start building)

What are your expectation damages? What are your restitution damages?
What are your reliance damages?

Expectation Damages
Net Benefit	+	All costs actually Expected		Incurred

---

## Construction contracts

Measuring Expectation Damages in Construction Contracts (when builder breaches)

Still: Net benefit + Costs Incurred

Two ways to measure net benefit side (left side). Under both ways:

What you expected to get minus what you actually got. Value of performance expected minus value received

Two ways to figure “Value”

**Diminution in value:**

Mkt price expected	-	Mkt price received

(Used when substantial performance) THINK BACK TO READING AND YOUNGS - THE PIPES -there was substantial performance because the harm to xxx was minimal - if we used cost of completion (cost to knock down and redo) it would be a windfall for kent. too much money.

**Cost of Completion**

(used when no substantial performance) THIS IS THE DEFAULT - you didn't finish doing what I contracted you to do, this is how much it would cost -  if there was no substantial performance jacob and youngs would have to pay what would it take to get the pipes that kent bargained for - they'd have to pull down the house and put in the pipes that kent wanted.

*remember that specific performance - finishing building the house as expected - is out of the question; specific performance is used very rarely by the courts because courts don't want to force people - involuntary servitude - to do something because there are all sorts of possible reasons why performance was not performed*

American Standard (p 700)

•	What were the contract terms?
•	What did defendant promise to do?
•	In what way did defendant breach?
•	What was defendant’s reason for that breach? (or are they arguing they didn’t breach?)
•	What measure of damages is each party arguing for?

... is basically equating it to jacob and reeeves - *the court does not punish a breach; the court compensates the party damaged by the breath*

all going to depend on whether the court is going to ask one party to give up all property -

the court says there was no substantial performance. awards cost of completion BECAUSE no substantial performance.

American Standard
•	D argues for diminution in value. Under that theory, what would damages be?

•	P argues for cost of completion. Under that theory, what would damages be?

Net benefit expected
•	What I expected to get	-	What I got

•	Full fair market value	-	Market value expected		as is

•	Land with no	-	Land with subsurface structures		subsurf structures

How does court decide which to award?
•	Which is the default calculation?
•	Why?
•	When is the other calculation used?

Factually how would you distinguish
American Standard from
Jacob and Youngs?

•	Harm to P? minimum. did they want no structures below surface; no, they really wanted the surface clear so they can resell it. what different with jacob and youngs? the difference is that in jacob and youngs it cost a lot because they had to pull down and redo; here there is no economic waste because the construction co had not done anything. american standard case is about freedom of contract.
in jacob and youngs it was an innocent mistake. here it was not an innocent mistake. the construction company knew. in jacob and youngs they... what the court is looking at is cutting corners. they dont have to dig underground -
•	Harm to D?
•	Fault?

## Measuring Restitution Damages

Something should go here. See also writing assignment 3.

Halliburton

On an exam id want to say net benefit (how much did the buyer expect to be better off by this contract - usu what's the contract price and what's the price the buyer would have to pay to replace the thing) in halliburton they didnt buy a replacement

youre always looking at the difference in value between what did they expect to get and what did they get. Tricky thing is you are looking often at lost profit and prof Z doesn't use the word profit because its not always profit.

the confusing thing is lost profits looks like it might be connected to net benefits and it can be but its really sth that happened as a result of the breach. this happened so that happened and that happened and that happened. things that happened because of the defect. the net benefit looks at what was expected and what was got. lost profits are profits lost as a result of the breach.

---

in Halliburton they are asking for lost profits. Because of the breach we lost 24 million sollars

---

expectation damages

net benefit + costs incurred

IS THE SAME AS

Value of goods expected minus value received + lost profits

(lost profits is a type of costs incurred)

costs incurred include consequential and ... damages

Now look at all three limitations for

mitigation
foreseeability
certainty

here halliburton we are looking at Certainty

---

certainty

must be certain in amount and in cauation

two different ISSUES

both must be proved with reasonable certainty

you must be reasonably certain of the amaount, and reasonably certain that the breach caused the lost profits/costs incurred

---

amount

doesnt have to be proved with mathematical precision. just reasonable certainty. (see sullivan [couldnt prove net benefit with reasonable certainty])


---

issues often surround lost profits and new Businesses
lost profits generally not recoverable for new Businesses
look for yardstick or some standard to determine the damages - yardstick or standard. you can look at your own past profits to determine lost profits, and you can also look at similar businesses in your are or not. if youre a ne

lost profits are not usually provable for new businesses but if you can prove you are competitive

---

Policy

"if the manufacturer of the nail becones,,,"

Reminds you that if a person is selling a $2 nail and they breach and owe $2,000,000 they'll go bankrupt and there will be no more nails.

reminds you that if you breach you expect damages so you dont do something if you think that you are going to be sued.

causation vs foreseeability

---

Foreseeability - Hadley

this is the landmark case for foreseeability - which is strange because in other ways not great analysis -

grift mill broken crank shaft - carrier took the crank shaft somewhere to be fixed and instead of it taking ten days it took fifteen days. every day mill was closed mill lost lots of money. carrier said we didn't know your mill would be closed or you would lose all those profits - we were just carrying your goods.

---

which theory/type of damages? expectation - there might not even have been expectations damages

where do lost profits fit in? take the amount of loss and plug it in - certainty not an issue; something else not an issue; the question is were the damages foreseeable

court said not foreseeable

---

## Foreseeability

**RULE FROM HADLEY + RESTATEMENT**

Hadley: loss must

- arise naturally from the breach, OR
- reasonably be in the contemplation of the parties

RST SEC 351 Loss must

- follow in the ordinary course of events, OR
- if not in the ordinary course then the breaching party must have reason to know

---

we're not asking whether the breach is foreseeable, but whether the damages are foreseeable.

---

damages to the rug - to the hardwood floors

if there is a gaping hole in the roof it is foreseeable that the hardwood floors will be damaged. It is not foreseeable that theres a million dollar Picasso. the damage to the Picasso does not arise naturally from the breach. but if the owner of the house tells the builder watch out theres a million dollar Picasso in that room, then it is foreseeable that the damage to the Picasso results from the breach, the builder knew or should have known.

say hadley says it this way and the rst says it this way

---

In Hadley, did the damages arise naturally from the ten-day delay?

No, because the mill could have a spare crank shaft. Or the mill could have closed for other reasons.

HOWEVER

Plaintiff servant told the clerk that the mill stopped and that the shaft should be sent immediately. this was not figured into the ruling.

legal scholars say that that sentence was written by the court reporter.

---

## Mitigation

Mitigation § 350
•	Court won’t compensate injured party for loss they could have avoided with reasonable effort / due diligence… or without undue risk, burden, or humiliation.
•	Can recover if they made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts.

Policy
–	Notions of fairness
–	Encourage socially responsible behavior
–	Prevent waste
–	A party shouldn’t be punished for breaching – not in and of itself a bad thing (sometimes better for everyone)

Examples
•	Roofer breaches by leaving gaping hole in the roof. Homeowner knows it’s going to rain and doesn’t cover the hole or move valuables away.
•	Tenant breaches a one year lease. Landlord lets the apartment sit vacant for a year and then sues for the rent.

What part of the expectation formula is at issue in each example?

the roofer breaches by leaving a hole - costs incurred
tenant breaches a one year lease - net benefit (failure to get what you expected to get under the contract) - but then did the landlord fail to mitigate? yes. if tried to re-rent then no, but yeah.

---

Is this correct?
•	I tendered the apartment (it was available for the year) so I’m entitled to the full rent. - no; you're entitled to the full rent minus the rent i got
•	I tendered the car (I was ready to hand it over when you breached) so I’m entitled to the full contract price for the car. no; we don't tell the buyer to buy the whole car; that's forcing the buyer to buy the car; that would be saying you cant breach; courts cant say that; you can breach, but you must pay damages. and the seller must try to sell the car to someone else. If i sell the car to someone else for 5000 you escape breach. thats fine; everybody's happy because everybody got what they want.
•	I was ready to perform/act in the movie, so I’m entitled to the full contract price (salary expected) no, normally you breached; i dont get my full salary; i have to find another job, but if i get another job for one hundred thousand dollars and you were going to give me one hundred and ten thousand dollars damages are ten thousand dollars. I only get that difference. generally.

Mitigation issues on Net Benefit side (mitigation is basically built into the equation because net benefit means the value of the thing I was expecting minus the value of the the thing I got;)
•	Need to subtract out the expected cost of performance OR subtract any expected mitigation (this is built in to the equation) - if you made reasonable efforts and you can show you made reasonable efforts -
–	I could sell the car to someone else so subtract what I could have gotten from someone else.
–	I could have rented the apartment to someone else so subtract rent I could have gotten from someone else.
–	I could have been in another movie so subtract the salary I could have gotten from the other movie.

Shirley MacLaine (p 725)
•	P entered K to be the lead in D’s movie, Bloomer Girl. Would be paid $53,000/week for 14 weeks (total $750,000).
•	D breached – decided not to produce the film.
•	P sues. Seeks $750,000 salary. (wait, you're not making the movie; are you saying you should get the whole salary?)
•	The issue is whether she failed to mitigate.
•	But first, consider the entire equation and what damages look like before limitations.

Damages
•	What type of damages does Maclaine seek? expectation damages
•	How do you calculate net benefit?	when its an employment contract and you have a wrongfully discharged employee, you look at the salary she expect minus the salary she got.

---

Net benefit for wrongfully discharged employees
•	How much did employee expect to be better off by taking this job (instead of some other job)

•	Agreed upon salary MINUS
•	Amount employee earned from other employment (or could have earned with reasonable effort)

Employee not required to take just any job

•	Must show:
–	Same field / same general line of work
–	Comparable / substantially similar

•	Can’t be:
–	Substantially different OR
–	Inferior

Shirley MacLaine said she didn't want the other movie the producer offered her. MacLaine's lawyers had to argue that she second movie offered to her was substantially different from the first. The two movies were very different in many ways. Musical - Western; California - somewhere else; strong female character - subordinate character.

Argument she should get the full
$750,000 (didn’t fail to mitigate)
