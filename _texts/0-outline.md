# I Introduction

**Contracts**

- Law of private agreements
- Exercise of individual freedoms
- Process of self-determination that involves exchanges and agreements between private parties
- Parties have almost unfettered freedom to make their own bargains

Default rules come from:

- Common law - determines what constitutes a contract
- Legislation
- UCC Art. 2 - Uniform Commercial Code governs the sale of goods. Services are not governed by UCC. Real Estate is not covered by UCC. UCC has a separate set of law from common law. If something is a good, UCC applies.
- UN CISG - like UCC but for international sale of goods
- Commentary
- Restatement (Second) of Contracts - not law; summary of law; very influential
- Law reviews, treatises, etc.

**Questions for analysis:**

Is there a contract? If contract, is it enforceable? What are the terms? Did a party breach? If there's breach, what are the damages?

Contract Law protects parties and society.

Why should the law enforce any promises?

1. Because of people's expectations; people expect that a contract will be enforced. If I sell you a car we can start relying on the agreement of the sale of the car. We want to protect the expectations of the parties.

2. We want to protect contracting for business. One thing that contract law doesn't do is penalize people for breaching contracts. This is not criminal law. We don't want to punish people for not observing contracts. We want to compensate the party who suffered.

**Hypo:** I rent you an apartment. You agree to rent it for 2000. You decide to go to California so you breach. Apartment empty for a month. Then I rent it for 3000. Should you compensate me for my loss due to breach of contract?

Reasons to enforce a promise:

- Both agreed (assent)
- Exchange is important as opposed to gifts
- Reliance
- unjust enrichment (dog hypo)

Reasons not to enforce a promise

- gift (no exchange)
- no real promise
- against public policy
- no assent

## Ia The Bargain Principle

Bargain Theory involves:

- Exchange / reciprocity (consideration) +
- Assent (offer and acceptance)
- Assumption: Bargains are motivated by self-interest

Underlying policy concerns:

- Fairness
- Reliance
- Efficiency

*See Section 2: problem posted on TWEN (What promises should the law enforce?)*

**Hypo** illustrating the blurred line between exchange and Gift: Uncle promises to pay nephew $5000 if he quits drinking and smoking until he turns 21; nephew quits; turns 21; $5000 not paid; nephew sues. Does he have a claim under the bargain principle? (Was the promise part of an exchange or a promise to give a gift?)   

**Kirksey v. Kirksey** (Supreme Court of Alabama 1845)

- Issue: Whether promise made to plaintiff by plaintiff's brother-in-law (defendant) that if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family" was a contract.
- Why issue matters: Issue matters because it raises the question of what elements are necessary for a promise to be a legal contract.
- Holding: Promise was a gift (no exchange)
- Factual arguments in support of that holding: plaintiff did not agree to do anything in exchange for living on defendant's farm.
- Factual counterarguments: there was exchange because plaintiff worked on defendant's farm.
- If I wanted to make this more clearly enforceable, I would rephrase the promise as "if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family [until a specified time] [in exchange for her doing work on his farm]."  

## Ib Theoretical perspectives

**Neo-Classical Economics:** Economic theory most closely associated with Bargain Theory (a deal's a deal etc.). Values efficiency and profit-making. Assumptions (pp 37-38):

- people act in their own self interest
- people act rationally
- people have access to perfect info
- people and resources are freely movable
- there are no artificial restrictions to entry to the market

As social justice lawyers we will consider: how can these assumptions be challenged?

**Socioeconomics (counter economic theory):**

- assumes we can't adequately understand economic behavior by the assumptions of autonomy, rationality, and efficiency
- considers social norms, disparate bargaining power, sexism, racism, educational inequalities and other inequalities
- recognizes the capacity for empathy

## Three principles of contract lawyers

- Bargain theory (agreement to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations)
- Reliance theory (involves promises to give gifts. Seeks to protect those who reasonably rely on others.)
- Restitution theory (one ought to pay for any benefit unjustly retained. Goal is to prevent unjust enrichment.)

# II Objectivity

This is where I'll write something about this.

## IIa Objective theory of interpretation

**Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.**

**R.L.M. Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc.**

- Issue:

- Holding:
- Factual arguments in support of that holding:
- Factual counterarguments:

Text pp 59-66, 82-87

## IIb Policy

What is the difference between the objective and subjective approaches to assent?

Why, as a policy matter, does contract law opt for the objective approach?

Case Briefing: Brief Embry for class.  I will post a sample brief on TWEN with a discussion of the choices that the author of the sample brief made.  Consider the differences between yours and the sample and the likely reasons for the differences.   

# III Assent

Text pp 87-88, 95-107 (top)

RST § 24

Working with Rules - Inferring Factors

What facts did the Pepsico court consider important in determining whether an offer had been made?  

Based on the court’s holding, use those facts to construct a rule that future courts can use to determine whether there was an offer.  

How does the rule on ads (and the exceptions thereto) fit within the rules on offer generally?

Working with Rules: Policy

What justifies the general rule on ads and offers? What justifies the exceptions? Whom do these rules protect and against what?

## Outlining

Write a synthesized rule statement for offer.  

## IIIb Was there acceptance?

RST § 30

UCC §§ 2-206, 2-207(1)

Text pp 116-127 (very top)

Working with Rules - Sources of Law and Theoretical perspective

In class, we will discuss Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as a source of authority of contract law.  How does the UCC differ from the RST in terms of its authority and scope?

Read UCC §§ 2-206 & 2-207(1).  Would Panhandle have been decided differently if it had been a sale of goods and subject to Article 2 of the UCC?  If so, how?

What justifies the common law mirror image rule? Under what circumstances does this rule protect the offeror?  Under what circumstance might it create incentives for opportunistic behavior?  Why does the UCC reject the mirror image rule? Generally speaking, is the UCC rule more generous to offerors or offerees?

In class, we will discuss the contrast between Formalism and Legal Realism as illustrated by the difference between the RST and the UCC.

## IIIc Revocation prior to acceptance

Text pp 185-205 (top)

Read the text of RST § 71 and all the comments and illustrations carefully.

## IVb Neo-Classical economic theory

It is said that courts won’t look at the adequacy or fairness of the consideration. Should sellers be permitted to charge what the market will bear in all cases?  What if that means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods?  What if it means charging women more than men or BIPOC consumers more than white consumers? Should it matter if members of those groups agree to pay more?

B.    Applications of the Consideration Doctrine: Gift with a Condition, Nominal Consideration, the Pre-Existing Duty Rule, and Illusory Promises

- Holding:
- Factual arguments in support of that holding:
- Factual counterarguments:

Text pp 205-214 (bottom), 218-219

Text pp 220-226

Theoretical perspective and Close Case Reading

What is the “primitive stage of formalism” that the Wood court is rejecting? Why is it being rejected?

What is Cardozo telling us about the relationship between the parties in the case? For whose benefit is the term implied?  Who was vulnerable under the contract as written?

## IVc Critical legal theory

The Paula Childress story beginning on p 226 is optional reading. It provides an account of the role of class, race, and poverty in the dehumanization of people who are poor. Does this attitude help explain the devaluation of the claim in the Lawrence case?

Would the outcome of Lawrence change if Ethel Lawrence had been a paying patient? What does this tell you about who is the least protected by the consideration doctrine?

What would have been a more persuasive way for the clinic to make the case that there was no consideration in Lawrence?

Consider: Baby M drafting exercise (posted under “class exercises”)

Make a list of policies for and against enforcing the Baby M contract (including the arguments from the case and the other readings).  Factors both favoring and disfavoring enforcement should include contract / law and economic arguments as well as social policy arguments.  	

Working with Facts

Consider the language the lower court used in characterizing the Whiteheads and the Sterns.  What differences are evident in tone and word choice? What language does the appellate court use in characterizing the Whiteheads and the Sterns?  Are there similar differences in tone and word choice?

Consider the role that these choices play in the process of legal analysis and the courts’ decisions.  How do these choices inform your reading of the case?

## VIIai Theoretical perspective

Consider any discomfort you may have with either the lower court or the appellate opinion.  Can you categorize your objection in terms of one or more of the theories we studied?

## VIIb Lack of capacity and who can contract?

RST § 15

Working with Rules: The Role of Policy in the Rule

Do you think the rule for minority is fair? Whom is the rule trying to protect and from what?  What assumptions does the rule make about minors? Are these assumptions valid?  How are those assumptions challenged empirically by the readings?

Working with Rules: The Role of Policy in the Rule

How is the test for mental capacity different from the test for minority? Why do you suppose the tests are different?  By comparing these rules, we can see that policy is built into each rule. What policy concerns underlie the different rules?

## VIIc Duress and force and threats

**Trane v. Bond**

- Issue:
- Why issue matters:
- Holding:
- Factual arguments in support of that holding:
- Factual counterarguments:

What’s the difference between     § 174 and § 175 in substance and in effect?  What elements are required under § 175(1) for a showing of duress by threat by the other party?  Read § 176.  When is a threat improper?  When might a threat be proper?

Note Taking and Outlining

With your study group, prepare answers to the questions about duress posted on TWEN under “Class Exercises.” You should be able to answer these questions from your notes, and some of the questions might help you in the process of converting your notes into an outline.

## VIIg Theoretical perspective

Consider background assumptions the court may have made about women and widows in Vokes.  What role do you think Vokes’s
gender played in the court’s reasoning? What role do you think race, class, or gender should play in analyzing a party’s behavior? We will use this case and these theoretical issues as the basis of a discussion on competing economic theories about the appropriate role of these characteristics in legal reasoning.
