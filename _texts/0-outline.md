## Sources of law

- **Common law** determines what constitutes a contract (RST restates common law)
- **Legislation**
- **Restatement (Second) of Contracts (common law)** is not law; summary of law; very influential
- **UCC Art. 2 - Uniform Commercial Code** governs the sale of goods. Does not govern services nor Real Estate. UCC separate from common law. If something is a good, UCC applies.
- **UN CISG** is like UCC but for international sale of goods
- **Commentary**
- **Law reviews, treatises, etc.**

## Bargain principle

The bargain principle includes the central belief that an agreement to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations. The motto "a deal is a deal" is a core tenet of the bargain principle. There is disagreement as to whether a deal is really a deal if it is made under conditions of coercion, duress, or inequality of power and resources. Rationales that justify the bargain principle include the belief that when two parties enter into a deal both sides are committed, one or both parties will count on the deal and rely on the deal to make a living, commercial exchange is crucial to a capitalist economy, deals are crucial to a free market system, and a free market system is essential to individual freedom.      

## Theoretical perspectives

**Neo-Classical Economics:** Economic theory most closely associated with bargain theory. "A deal's a deal." Values efficiency and profit-making. Assumptions:[^1]

[^1]:As social justice lawyers we will consider: how can these assumptions be challenged?

- people act in their own self interest
- people act rationally
- people have access to perfect info
- people and resources are freely movable
- there are no artificial restrictions to entry to the market

**Socioeconomics (counter economic theory):** Assumes we can't adequately understand economic behavior by the assumptions of autonomy, rationality, and efficiency. Considers social norms, disparate bargaining power, sexism, racism, educational inequalities and other inequalities. Recognizes the capacity for empathy.

**(Legal) Formalism:** Words rule. They have a distinct meaning.

**Contextual approach:** The objective test

# Objective theory of contract interpretation

## Objective theory approach

The "objective theory" of interpretation provides that words and conduct should be interpreted as a “reasonable person” would interpret them. The “objective theory” assumes that a standard of shared meaning already exists or that one ought to exist. This assumption is controversial. However, for lack of a better system, courts generally use the objective standard to determine the meaning of words, conduct and circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable person. The reasonable person standard is used to determine (1) whether there was an offer, and (2) whether there was acceptance.

**R.L.M. Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc.** 723 F. Supp. 421 (D. Ariz. 1988)

In RLM Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc., the court found found that custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement because the custom in the industry was that if you transfer a business you also transfer distribution rights. In RLM, the court found that absent any other facts, it was reasonable to believe that parties were following custom. Therefore, there was an agreement between RLM and Taylor. Here, the court will likely find [rule] because [legally relevant facts from exam].

- **Rule:** Contract assent can be express or implied. Agreements can be implied in whole or in part through conduct alone or through usage of trade. *See RST Contracts Section 4* An implied agreement concerning the issue of transferability may arise in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary if custom or practice in the industry provides for such an understanding.

- **Note:** The very fact that you are using the objective test means that there was no express intent - there was no explicit "I promise to sell you my car."

## Varieties

## Universal RP test

- Only relevant evidence is the specific words and content being interpreted. Words have set meaning. Positioned outside of the history and circumstances of the parties and apart from the context in which they were uttered or performed. Associated with a formalist approach to law and legal interpretation not generally followed today. If the court were using this test in Embry, it would only look at the words McKittrick said, not context. Embry's request is context. The context and timing led the court to find that there was a contract. Critique of universal reasonable person test: it favors the powerful party.

## Positioned RP test

- Interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a "universal" observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication. *This was used by the court in Embry.* Relevant evidence includes evidence of the history of the parties' relationship and of the circumstances surrounding the communications.

- Turn the facts into factors. If you take these facts and turn them into factors you can use in the next case, then you can use them.

## Factors for positioned RP test

- clarity of representation
- seriousness
- definiteness / level of detail
- context
- relationship of the parties
- prior dealings
- industry custom
- urgent need / time sensitivity?
- Etc.

What was said? And what would that lead a reasonable person to believe? Use factors.

**Charles R Embry v Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods Company** Missouri Court of Appeals 105 S.W. 777 (1907)

In McKittrick, the court found Embry did not satisfy the positioned reasonable person standard because it was reasonable for an employee in Embry's position to believe when he heard "go ahead, your are all right, get your men out, don't let that worry you," combined with surrounding circumstances such as the past interactions between employer and employee, that he was contracted by McKittrick for another year. Therefore, there was a contract between McKittrick and Embry. Here, the court will likely find [rule] because [legally relevant facts from exam].

- **Rule:** If the words or acts of two parties would be understood by a reasonable person to manifest the intention of both parties to enter into a contract, a contract is created, regardless of whether a party did not intend to enter into the contract so long as a reasonable person would find that the inner intention is not embodied in the words used by or acts of the parties. (62 4th para)

**United Steelworkers of America, Local 1330 v. U.S. Steel** USDC for the Northern District of Ohio, 492 F. Supp. 1 (1980)

In Local 1330 v. U.S. Steel, the court found that U.S. Steel's statements asking workers to help keep the company open did not represent a promise made by the corporation to not shut the steel mills down if profit increased. The workers alleged that the company had promised to keep the plants open as long as they remain profitable if the workers took wage concessions, which the workers took, thinking this would keep the steel mills open and save their jobs. The workers claimed that there was a promise based on various statements of the company executives. The question was whether the company's statement was an enforceable promise. Here the court took a very narrow focus and held that U.S. Steel's statement that "your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate" did not represent a promise made by the corporation on which the workers should have reasonably relied. The court reasoned that the statement made by U.S. Steel was not specific enough to constitute a unilateral contract accepted by workers through full performance of the actions the statement asked them to perform.

- Note: If you wanted to say yes there was a promise, you look at the relationships, how people had very little power. Make the case by putting yourself in the shoes of the workers, what they heard and how they world interrpret it.

**Death of a Salesman Hypo**

1. Willy doesn't want to travel any more. Asks Howard (son of the old owner) for an office job in town.
2. Suppose that Howard's father said to Willy, "i'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town."
3. Would a reasonable person in Willy's shoes think that a promise was made?

- **Willy** would argue that there was a promise because a reasonable person in Willy's shoes who heard the owner of his business say "I'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town..." would think a promise was made, based on the relationship of owner-employee, industry custom to promise future employment in this type of casual conversation, level of specificity (in town), etc. Therefore, there was an enforceable promise.
- **Loman** would argue that there was not a promise because a reasonable person in Willy's shoes who heard the owner of his business say "I'm sure when you decide you want to stop traveling, we'll be able to find a place for you here in town..." wouldn't think there was a promise of office employment in the future based on the conversation was years ago, not clear, definite or detailed, used the words "I'm sure." Therefore, there was not an enforceable promise. ("I'm sure" is often used colloquially to mean the exact opposite: I'm not sure. Use factors. Statement lacks clarity and definiteness (i.e. "a place"))
- Note: Think of the relationship of the parties. An employee and an employer. An employee asking a question of his employer.

**Bar/farm hypo**

- People drinking in a bar. One contracts to sell their farm to the other for $50,000. Farm was really worth a lot more. Next day seller refuses to sell saying they didn't really promise (just kidding). Enforceable promise? Yes. Here we don't have facts that say they were incapacitated because they were drunk, so we assume they had capacity.

## Socially situated RP analysis

Interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a "universal" observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication but who also has the social identity of the recipient. Draws from the UN CISG, which provides that statements and conduct of contracting parties should be interpreted according to the parties' own shared meanings, but if these cannot be ascertained, then the statements should be interpreted according to the understanding that "a reasonable person *of the same kind* (including nationality, culture, religion and the like) as the other party would have had in the same circumstances." Relevant evidence includes history and circumstances of the communication and also the practices of the parties' trades or communities and their own experiences in negotiations of this sort. Critics of the socially situated theory argue that it is better to challenge class and other bias in the objective theory than to invite judges to indulge in stereotypical versions of others' perspectives, which is very essentializing.

## Problems with RP standard

The critique of the reasonable person test, whichever way you look at it, is the problem of bias, of essentializing. Race. Gender. Class. The objective test is the test that courts use, because it's more rational than the subjective test. So we have to figure out how to use it in the least harmful way. The key is that either a reasonable person interpreted something in a way or *should have* interpreted it in that way.

## Using the objective test

Questions to ask: How did the court determine what a reasonable person would have thought? What facts did the court rely on? What facts support a counterargument that a reasonable person would have thought in a way?


## Subjective theory of interpretation

Under the "subjective theory" of interpretation the court would evaluate what both people actually thought (by indirect evidence) and the court would only find a contract if there had been a "meeting of the minds."  The subjective test allows for differences between people and aims to prevent contracts being formed by accident. The problem with the subjective theory of interpretation is that it is extremely difficult to determine what people actually thought. The subjective theory approach was taken by the trial court in Embry, where the jury was instructed that if they found that both parties expressed the intent to contract with the other party for the plaintiff’s employment for one year, they should find that the parties thereby entered into a contract. At appeal, the court questioned whether this jury instruction was a correct statement of law, asking whether the formation of a contract depended on the intention of the then plaintiff and the then defendant or on the words spoken by both parties. The higher court took the objective theory approach which resulted in a reversal of the lower court's ruling.

# III. Theories of Relief

## A. Bargain theory

The bargain theory is a theory of relief where a promise to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations. Under the bargain theory, an enforceable promise becomes a contract where there is assent (offer and acceptance) and reciprocity (consideration). Closely related to neo-classical economic theory, the bargain  values efficiency and profit-making and assumes that bargains are motivated by self-interest and that people act in their own self interest, rationally and with access to perfect information, that people and resources are freely movable and that there are no artificial restrictions to entry to the market.

Or

A bargain is an agreement to exchange promises or to exchange a promise for a performance or to exchange performances. Under the bargain theory of relief where a promise to exchange one thing for another gives rise to mutual obligations, an enforceable promise becomes a contract where there is assent (offer and acceptance) and reciprocity (consideration).

# Contract Formation Elements

## Assent

Assent, or mutual assent, sometimes called the meeting of the minds of the parties, is the expressed willingness of each party to enter into an agreement. No contract is formed unless both parties assent. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts (“RST”) § 3 defines an agreement as a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons. For there to be assent, there must be an offer and an acceptance of that offer.

Note on the polarity of the offer-acceptance model: In § 2-204(b) of the UCC, Professor Karl Llewelyn sought to reform the "yes/no - was there a contract" polarity of contract formation in "(b) An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined." This allows courts to develop a flexible open-ended model of contract formation in contracts for the sale of goods.

## Offer and acceptance

Offer and Acceptance: both require assent. Two steps:

1. Did a party make an offer?   
2. Was there acceptance?  

Did there come a time in the communication between the parties when either party communicated a "willingness to enter into a bargain, so made to justify [a reasonable person in the position of the other party] in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it"? See RST § 24.

## Offer

Under RST § 24, an offer is a manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by an offeror to an offeree. This rule is interpreted by the courts the objective theory of interpretation, which provides that words and conduct of the parties should be interpreted as a reasonable person would interpret them, to determine whether the communications of the parties constitute an offer. No formalities, such as words of promise, are required; the offer may be written or spoken, communicated by other conduct, or implied by facts, and the offer can be made by the buyer or seller.

**Breakdown:** Under RST § 24, an offer is a "manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by offeror to offeree."

- No formalities are required.
- May be written or spoken or other conduct.
- May be implied by the facts.
- Offer can be made by the buyer or seller.

All that is required are words or conduct that would lead a reasonable person in the shoes of the party to believe a promise has been made.

Hypos: are these an offer? THE THREE HYPOS ARE IN SLIDES

**Rancher hypo:** 5/20 Rancher stops by to talk to his neighbor. Tells neighbor he's interested in selling his ranch and asks if neighbor is interested in buying. Neighbor says he's interested and he will see if he can find the money. Rancher says he'll determine the value of the property and get back to the neighbor. 6/13 neighbor calls the rancher to see if he was still selling. Rancher replies that he was still selling and that there's just a little delay. Says, "don't worry, everything is in order." 6/17 Rancher sends a letter to the neighbor and to three other neighbors asking if they'd be interested in buying the ranch. The letter details the price and all the terms. Did the rancher an offer to the neighbor? Did he make an offer to the other neighbors? No. This is an advertisement. Too many people. An advertisement that induces performance can be an offer.  

**Hypo:** I promise to give you $100 if you give me the apples. The whole thing is an offer.

**Hypo:** The Gap is putting an ad in the paper that they are selling a sweater (see slide class of 1-20-21)

**Hypo:** Will you sell me your property for $60,000? I said yes. Seems like no, it's not an offer because it's too vague and doesn't provide enough detail, and isn't a promise.

## Four factors

A court will weigh and balance a series of factors when considering whether there was a manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by an offeror to an offeree. These factors include language, including whether there were words of promise or commitment; the level of detail of the communication’s terms; the number of people the communication was addressed to, and whether the communication named a party or parties; trade usage and/or custom including relevant community practices; prior dealings and/or conversations between the parties; characterization including whether the communication was a price quote, advertisement, or other factors. One or more factors may have stronger weight than others depending on the context of the communication.

**Breakdown:** A court will weigh/balance factors when considering whether there was a manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by an offeror to an offeree. One or more factors may have stronger weight than others depending on the context of the communication.

1. **Language - words of promise or commitment?** Did the words of the communication indicate a willingness, at that moment, to make a committment? If so, the communication appears more like an offer.
2. **Level of detail** Did the communication include detailed terms? If so, the communication appears more like an offer.
3. **Number of people (and does it name a party or parties?** To how many people was the communication directed? If to one person, the communication appears more like an offer.
4. **Trade usage/custom** Are there any relevant community practices ("trade practices")
5. **Prior Dealings/prior conversations** Are there past conversations between the parties, past contracts between the parties ("course of dealings"), or other circumstances that would inform a reasonable person's interpretation of the communication? If so, these may make the communication appear to be more or less like an offer.
6. **Characterization (price quotation, ad...)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Generaliizations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">1. Generally, advertisements should not be characterized as offers because they are addressed to a large number of people.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">2. Generally, price quotes, catalogues and price lists should not be characterized as offers because they are phrased in general terms, not focused on a specific order or job, and are addressed to many people.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">3. Generally, putting a price tag on an item and putting it on a shelf in a store should not be characterized as an offer because sellers can change a price tag or remove the item without notifying buyers.</p>

**Hypos:**

- Will you sell me your property for $60,000?
- It would not be possible for me to sell it unless I would receive $70,000 cash.
- Do you want to buy 240 good 1000 lb cattle for $1000?

**Offer Factors:** these are some of the factors we would use to see if there was an offer in the rancher test. It's similar to the factors in the objective test. This list is a bit particular to offers.

- **Language** – words of promise or commitment? For there to be an offer there doesn't have to be words of promise; but if there are that makes it more likely that there is an offer.
- **Level of detail:** in Rancher hypo not much detail in first convo, but in letter a lot more, and the more detail the more like an offer.
- **Number of people to whom addressed (and does it name a party or parties?):** in Rancher four people; that's not infinite, very finite, but still more thhan hhe could accommodate. Also did Rancher name people? Yes, neighbors, so more liikeley offer
- **Trade usage / custom:**  
- **Prior dealings / prior conversations:** for example we have been dealing with each other and month to month contract but every month we renew so we understand there's an expectation to renew
- **Characterization (price quotation, ad…):** if its an ad, it's usually not an offer; if it's a reward, it usually is an offer.

**Additional Factors Consideredin Pepsico:**

- **Price:** the court says that the price is very low because -the jet is worth about 23 million dollars. If the price is extremely disproportionate to the actual value, the less likely it is to be an offer.
- **Ability to follow through:** fighter jet not for regular consumption; Pepsico not likely to be able to follow through with delivering a Harrier jet to a sixteen-year old.
- **Level of seriousness:** a reasonable person would understand that it's a joke.
- **Characterization of the proposal:** What does the court say about Ads?

## Yes offers

**The following are *usually* considered offers:**

- Offer of Rewards
- Prove me wrong offers
- Prizes for skill and luck

Factors here:

- Limits the number of people who can accept
- Induces action

## No not offers

- Advertisements
- price quotes, catalogues, price lists
- putting price tag on an item and placing it on a shelf in a store

## Advertisement

Generally, an advertisement is not an offer because it is usually addressed to a large number of people and phrased in general terms. Instead, there is a presumption that an ad is a solicitation of an offer, or a mere request to consider and examine and negotiate unless the circumstances are exceptional, and the words used are very plain and clear. *Leonard v. Pepsico*, 88 F.Supp. 2d 116 (1999). For an advertisement to be an offer, there must be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without further communication. An ad is more likely to be considered an offer if it (1) limits the number of people who can accept; (2) invites performance; and (3) communicates willingness to commit.

**Breakdown:** SEE SLIDE FROM CLASS WITH SUB-RULES!!!

**Presumption:**  Solicitation of offer / invitation to negotiate. Even if it has all the detail in it, it's still presumed to be a solicitation of an offer rather than an offer, *because it goes to a lot of people* - it doesn't matter how detailed it is. It's not an offer unless it fits into one of the exceptions.

**Exceptions**

1. Limits number of people who can accept, e.g., "first come first served"; "while supplies last"
2. Invites performance, e.g. offer for a reward, prove me wrong, or prizes for skill and luck (I've only got one cat so I've limited the number of people, and I've induced performance); they're not worried about the number of people who will... *Carbolic Smoke Ball*
3. Communicates willingness to commit

---

**Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.** (discussed in Pepsi)

- In *Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.*, the court found that an ad was an offer because it invited performance by stating that the company would give £100 to anyone who used the product and still got the flu, the advertiser invited performance by calling on the public to prove it wrong and communicated a willingness to commit by promising a reward if they did.
- Rule/Law: Advertisements offering rewards are offers to anyone who does perform the conditions named in the advertisement, and anybody who does perform the condition accepts the offer. RST § 24 (I think).

**John D.R. Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.** U.S. District Court, SDNY (1999)  

- In Pepsico, the court found that a TV ad displaying a person redeeming Pepsi points in exchange for a Harrier jet was not an offer because it did not have clear, definite and explicit terms and because the details of the offer were reserved by Pepsico to a separate writing in its catalogue.

- In Pepsico, the court found that a TV ad displaying a person redeeming Pepsi points in exchange for a Harrier jet was not an offer because a reasonable person in appellant Leonard's position would have understood that the commercial stating that the Harrrier jet could be purchased with 7,000,000 Pepsi Stuff points was a joke.  

- **Rule/Law:** For an advertisement to be an offer, there must be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without further communication (could this invitation to take action be an order form?). (99) Advertisements are mere requests to consider and examine and negotiate unless the circumstances are exceptional and the words used are very plain and clear. (99) An advertisement is not transformed into an enforceable offer merely by a potential offeree's expression of willingness to accept the offer through, among other means, completion of an order form. (99) Advertisements and the completion of order forms are mere notices and solicitations for offers. (99) Purchase orders are not enforceable contracts until they are accepted by the seller (99-100). RST § 26 states that "[a] manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has madde a further manifestation of assent" (100).

Arguments that Pepsico was not an offer: It was just an advertisement; this was an ad on TV; TV ads are exactly the kind of ad that are generally not considered an offer.

Counterarguments: You can make the case that Pepsico seeks to induce performance, and that performance is to collect Pepsico points. On the one hand you could say that it's inducing performance, because you keep buying Pepsis. The court did not agree, and said that pepsi was not inducing promise, but inducing a counter promise.

- If just an ad, what about the rest of the items in the commercial (leather jacket, sun glasses, etc.)? Answer: if it's just an ad, and there are no exceptions, there's no issue with the leather jacket or the sunglasses; this is not an offer.

Arguments that Pepsico is NOT an offer:

- Characterization: Not that definite
- Trade usage: not in the catalog
- Level of seriousness: just a joke   
- Price:  Too good to be true

Arguments that Pepsico WAS an offer:

- Same level of commitment / definiteness as other items in the commercial
- Price: maybe reasonable person not aware of price discrepancy or that it is a fighter jet  
- Trade usage:

Apply socially situated RP test - court says ad is targeting younger generation - the Pepsi generation - you might say that a reasonable teenager doesn't know that it is a fighter jet.

*Based on the court’s holding, use the facts that the Pepsico court consider important in determining whether an offer had been made to construct a rule that future courts can use to determine whether there was an offer.*  

**Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus** (discussed in Pepsi)

# Acceptance

Acceptance of an offer is defined in RST § 50 as a manifestation of assent to the terms of the offer, made by the offeree in a manner invited or required by the offer. This rule is interpreted by the courts using the objective theory of interpretation, defined above. To determine whether there was acceptance, courts usually apply the positioned reasonable person test which interprets the meaning of words and conduct according to the understanding of a “universal” observer who is placed in the position of the recipient of the communication. Relevant evidence includes evidence of the history of the parties’ relationship and of the circumstances surrounding the communications and takes into account the mode and manner of acceptance, if any, specified in the offer.

Generally, an offer may specify any mode or manner of acceptance that the offeror desires. However, if the offeror does not specify that a specific manner of acceptance is the only accepted manner, a court will interpret the offer to allow acceptance in any reasonable manner. The mode and manner of acceptance also depends on whether an offer is bilateral or unilateral. In bilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for a promise, acceptance happens with the return promise, and both parties are bound when the return promise is made. Bilateral contracts follow the mirror image rule where acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer and even small, unimportant change will result in no acceptance, becoming instead a counteroffer. In unilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for performance, acceptance occurs when the offeree renders full performance, and neither party is bound unless and until the offeree has performed. Because courts generally favor bilateral offers, a unilateral offer must specify that it can be accepted only by performance, otherwise it will be deemed bilateral by a court. If the offer specifies that it can only be accepted by full performance, the contract is not formed until the offeree has performed everything specified in the offer. After this is done, only the offeror needs to perform because the offeree has fully performed.

## Mirror image rule

Under the mirror image rule, acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer. Even small, unimportant change will result in no acceptance, but instead become a counteroffer.

**Hypo:** If I say I'll sell you my house for $5000, and you say yes I'll buy it as long as you vacate it on Tuesday. You've modified the terms. You created new obligations without my assent. So when you change the terms you're making a counteroffer. Your acceptancce is not a mirror image of the offer.

**Hypo:** If I say I'll sell you my house for $5000, but to be vacated Thursday. If you say "ok great I'll buy your house but can you vacate on Wednesday?", you still have an offer because you aren't changing the terms. If, however, you said "yes great I'll buy your house but only if you vacate on Wednesday " here, you no longer have an offer because you have changed the terms.

You turn my offer into a counteroffer, you become the new offeror. I become the new offeree.

## Counteroffer

- offer made by offeree to offeror
- Relating to same matter as original offer
- proposing substitute bargain
- No K until the counteroffer accepted

Sub-rules from this case (Panhandle?) (see slides for rule):

- Acceptance is still effective if the "addition" only asks for something that was implied in the offer anyway. *Panhandle*
- still an acceptance if "mere request"
- still an acceptance if offeree expresses dissatisfaction with the offer but still manifests intent to accept ("grumbling acceptance")

---

**Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Nowlin Smith, Jr.** Wyoming Supreme Court 637 P.2d 1020 (1981) *Panhandle also in manner or mode of acceptance!*

In Panhandle v. Smith, the court found that Smith accepted Panhandle's offer to withdraw Smith's discharge even though Smith added words to the letter of discharge because the notes that Smith wrote on the letter were "grumbling" and were not a modification of the offer. The court found that the term added by Smith that he be able to view his personnel file were implicit in the offer because by CBA all employees had a right to view their personnel file. Therefore, this condition was not a new term that modified the contract and was thus not a counteroffer.

- **Rule/Law:** (2) An acceptance is still effective if the addition only asks for something that would be implied from the offer and is therefore immaterial. (p. 109)

---

## Mode or manner of Acceptance

**General rule:** An offer may specify any manner of acceptance that the offeror desires. (p. 109) If the offeror does not specify that a specific manner of acceptance is the only accepted manner, a court will interpret the offer to allow acceptance in any reasonable manner.

**Breakdown:** Rules for mode of acceptance

- Offeror is master of the offer
- Offeror can demand an exclusive mode of acceptance
- Must be clear/expressly stated that exclusive mode of acceptance (must be clear that the only way offeree can accept the offer - court is not going to be eager because courts favor contracts in general)
- Otherwise, court will interpret offer as allowing acceptance in any reasonable manner
- Example: contract said if you want to accept reply by return mail. If person hand delivers reply, arguably it is a valid mode of acceptance, because the mode of acceptance is specific but reply by return mail does not say *only* reply by return mail.

**UCC Article 2-206** provides "Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances ... an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances." (p. 110) (UCC Art. 2 applies to the sale of goods [anything movable], not to sale of real estate or sale of services; UCC is a realist code - more flexible/liberal approach to contract formation). Art 2 was drafted by legal realists in the 1950s; trying to reflect reality rather than something rigid. It was written to cover buying and selling goods in the marketplace; the goal is to promote the free flow of ccontracts in the marketplacce; so important for jobs and stuff that goods be freely changing hands - so legal realists decided to come up with a set of rules that would reflect human experience. In a one-on-one situation the mirror image rule makes sense, but in the marketplace businesses have forms which they use over and over.

**Widget hypo:** Typical scenario: you have a merchant who sells widgets. They get a lawyer who drafts their purchase form. Buyers have lawyers who draft their purchase orders. Sellers might have terms saying that they disclaim all warranties; buyers might have a term that says valid in all state of PA. Buyer says i want to buy 500 widgets. Seller says ok great i'll sell you 500 widgets. what they're buying and selling is what they want to buy and sell and is the same, but their forms will be different, so the mirror image rule doesn't make sense in this kind of situation. Therefore,

1. the sale of good under UCCC art. 2, the mirror rule does not apply.
2. you can have a contract even if the acceptance has terms different from the offer, as long as the "bargained for" terms agree (you can have different language in the boilerplate)
- terms are: everything the parties have agreed to + whatever the code fills into the gap as the rule (the code is the UCC)

Note: UCC acceptance rule is identical to the common law. The only time we need to know is when the mirror image rule does not apply (when between merchants)

**Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Nowlin Smith, Jr.** Wyoming Supreme Court 637 P.2d 1020 (1981) *Panhandle also in counteroffer!*

In Panhandle v. Smith, the court found that Smith accepted Panhandle's offer to withdraw Smith's discharge even though Smith added words to Pandandle's letter of discharge because Panhandle did not specify that the mode of acceptance of its offer excluded all other modes of acceptance including writing any words on the letter of discharge. The court found that the requirement that Smith not write on the letter is unreasonable because the only reason the court surmised that Panhandle could have for stipulating that Smith not write on the letter was "an inordinate fondness for tidy sheets of paper." Unreasonable requirements must be specified in the communicated offer.

- **Rule/Law:** (1) An offeror has the right to accept an exclusive mode of acceptance from an offeree. An exclusive mode of acceptance can be unreasonable or difficult if it clearly excludes all other modes of acceptance, and this intention is expressed in the communicated offer itself.

## Bilateral v uniletaral contracts

*The only difference between these theories is in acceptance (this is why it goes under acceptance in the outline)*

Generally, an offer may specify any mode or manner of acceptance that the offeror desires. However, if the offeror does not specify that a specific manner of acceptance is the only accepted manner, a court will interpret the offer to allow acceptance in any reasonable manner. The mode and manner of acceptance also depends on whether an offer is bilateral or unilateral. In bilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for a promise, acceptance happens with the return promise, and both parties are bound when the return promise is made. Bilateral contracts follow the mirror image rule where acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer and even small, unimportant change will result in no acceptance, becoming instead a counteroffer. In unilateral contracts, a promise is made in exchange for performance, acceptance occurs when the offeree renders full performance, and neither party is bound unless and until the offeree has performed. Because courts generally favor bilateral offers, a unilateral offer must specify that it can be accepted only by performance, otherwise it will be deemed bilateral by a court. If the offer specifies that it can only be accepted by full performance, the contract is not formed until the offeree has performed everything specified in the offer. After this is done, only the offeror needs to perform because the offeree has fully performed. A unilateral offer will implicitly require full performance if it requests the offeree do something dangerous, risky, or unlikely to occur.

**Breakdown:**

Bilateral:

- promise in exchange for promise
- acceptance happens with return promise
- both parties bound when the return promise is made

Unilateral:

- promise in exchange for performance
- acceptance occurs when offeree renders full performance
- no one is bound unless/until offeree performs
- offer must specify that it can be accepted only by performance

**Bilateral vs. unilateral hypos:**

(I) I promise to pay you $30 if you deliver these apples. "Ok." bilateral or unilateral?

- Answer: bilateral because not clear that it is unilateral. Every contract is conditional on someone doing something. Most contracts are bilateral. Just using the word "if" does not make it unilateral. "ok" makes it sound like a promise - makes it sound bilateral. two ways to interpret: one is that "ok" is a promise. Other way is i'll pay you if and only if you deliver these apples. If he had said "I'll pay you when the apples are delivered" it would be unilateral. Would would a reasonable person think? **MAJOR GUIDELINE: STRONG PREFERENCE FOR BILATERAL AND STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT THE PARTIES WANTED IT TO BE BILATERAL.** Presumption is that a reasonable person would think it were bilateral.

(2) Frank: "I promise to pay you $100 if you paint my fence." Barb: "ok."

- Really the same thing as (I). It's unclear. You can make arguments on both sides. But the best answer would take into account the strong preference for bilateral contracts.

(3) Frank: "I promise to pay you $100 if you find and return my lost cat." Barb: "ok."

- This is the same as (1) and (2) except that it's not. Would a reasonable person be promising to find the cat? The presumption shifts when the offer is for a reward. Finding the cat is unlikely. Not guaranteed. A reasonable person would probably think that she is not promising to find the cat.

**Typical examples of unilateral contracts**

- offer of a reward
- contest
- standard insurance contract
- at will employment
- Rule: an offer will implicitly require full performance if it requests the offeree do something dangerous, risky, or unlikely to occur.

What are the implications of characterizing something as unilateral rather than bilateral? How do you know which is called for?

- K interpretation
- Look at parties' intent
- Objective test
- Court preference for bilateral

**Acceptance by promise (express or implied): bilateral contracts:** Usually, an acceptance will take the form of an express or implied promise (someone can accept an offer by making a promise). Promise to purchase in response to listing of sale (Southworth v. Oliver, p. 110); hand shake; handing of keys of motorbike to offeror of purchase. If an offer permits an acceptance by promise, then both parties are bound by the contract as soon as the return promise is made ("cross promises"). There are two promises. Hence bilateral. (p. 111)

**Acceptance by full performance: unilateral contracts:**  If the offer specifies that it can only be accepted by full performance, the contract is not formed until the offeree has performed everything specified in the offer. After this is done, only the offeror needs to perform because the offeree has fully performed. Because only one party is obligated, this is a unilateral contract. (p. 111) In the past unilateral contracts were limited to rewards ("$500 if you find my dog") and contests ("$20 if you score five basketss in five minutes"). Now, many contracts are unilateral; for example, an insurance contract where insurance company promises to pay if insuree pays premium. An at-will employment contract is unilateral; courts have found that the employer makes a new offer each day and the employee accepts the offer by going to work each day. (p. 112)

1. When an offer may be accepted by any reasonable means an offeree may accept by full performance or by promise. **RST § 32:** In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.
2. Sometimes an offer will expressly require acceptance by promise or accceptance by full performance as an exclusive mode of acceptancce.
3. If the offer requests that the offeree do something dangerous, risky or unlikely to occur, the offer will implicitly require full performance. (p. 111)

---

## Acceptance by silence

The general rule is that silence cannot be acceptance. There are three exceptions:

1. when the parties explicitly agree that silence will constitute acceptance (e.g. "if you don't hear from me by Friday you can assume the offer is accepted by us");
2. when the parties' past dealings have established a practice in which silence conveys acceptance (i.e. when the parties have impliicitly agreed that silence will be accceptance); and
3. when the offeree has already received the benefits of the offered contract.

**Theodore B. Russell v. Texas Co.** U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, 238 F.2d 636 (1956)

- **Issue:** Whether an offeree may vitiate a contract by a claim of lack of intention to accept an offer when he accepts and retains the benefits offered to him by the offeror, with a positive and affirmative proviso by the offeror that such acceptance of the benefits will, in and of itself, be deemed by the offeror to be an acceptance. (p. 115)
- **Narrow Issue:** Whether Texas Co. accepted Russel's offer of a revocable license for use of real property section 23.
- **Facts:**
- **I. Uncontested facts:** Russell's predecessors acquired section 23 from the Northern Pacific Railway Company through a contract in 1918. In the contract and deed were miniral rights. The Texas Co. conducted operations in section 23 since 1952 under an oil and gas lease granted by Norrthern Pacific Railway Company. The Texas Co. has also made use of the surface of section 23.   
- **II. Appellant Russel’s factual allegations:** Russel argued that its offer of a license to Texas Co. stated that the continued use of section 23 constituted acceptance.  
- **III. Respondent Texas Co.’s factual allegations:** Texas Co. argued that it never accepted Russel's offer of a revocable license for the use of section 23 because Texas Co. did not intend to accept this offer.
- **IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:**
- **Procedural History:** Russell sued Texas Co. for nonpayment in trial court. The trial court found that Texas Co. had accepted Russel's offer of a revocable contract and ruled that Texas Co. should therefore pay Russell damages. Texas Co. appealed.  
- **Court’s Reasoning:** See application below.
- **Rule/Law:** Under RST § 72.2 "Where the offeree exercises dominion over things which are offered to him, such exercise of dominion in the absence of other circumstances showing a contrary intention is an acceptance, though the offeree manifests an intention not to accept.""
- **Application:** The court applied the reasonable person test which asks whether or not the offeror was led to reasonably believe that the act of the offeree was an acceptance; the court found that in this case, it was. (p. 116)
- **Policy:**
- **Holding:** An offeree may vitiate a contract by a claim of lack of intention to accept an offer when he accepts and retains the benefits offered to him by the offeror, with a positive and affirmative proviso by the offeror that such acceptance of the benefits will, in and of itself, be deemed by the offeror to be an acceptance.
- **Disposition:** Judgement affirmed as to appelants.
- **Context (why the case was assigned):** To illustrate acceptance by silence.

## End User License Agreements (EULAs)

**Click wrap:** Applies to internet transactions.  

- User must click on box saying “I agree.”

**Browse wrap:** Like click wrap but you don’t have to click “I agree.” Website provides notice of the terms and conditions.

- User must have actual or constructive knowledge of the website’s terms and conditions
- Depends on design and content of the website
- Court looks for textual notice on every page -- user has to go past to get to site
- Notice must be conspicuous and well-placed
- PLUS language directing user to terms “Read our terms before signing..”

**Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc.** U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit 763 F.3d 1171 (2014)

In Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc., the court found that the mere presence of a link without some obvious prompt to take affirmative action was not sufficient to bind a user to an arbitration agreement described in the terms and conditions. Using basic offer and acceptance terms, the court found that there must be a mutual manifestation of intent and the user must have actual or constructive knowledge of the websites' terms and conditions. The onus is on the website owner to provide the user with actual or constructive knowledge that by visiting the website the user agrees to the terms and conditions hyperlinked to the website. In this case you can see the court's disfavor of browse wrap contracts. The Court is requiring very specific placement of information.

**Shrink wrap:**  Applies to store bought software (or over the phone).  

- Reference to license agreements is placed on the outside of the software packaging.

**Shrink wrap hypo:** Consumer orders computer software from Gateway; software arrives including list of terms; says these terms will apply if the customer uses the software or fails to return it after 30 days; customer keeps the software for more than 30 days; later has a complaint about the software; one term says mandatory arbitration; consumer wants to sue in court.

- **Issue:** Are these additional terms part of the contract? (is he limited to arbitration?) Customer says he didn't agree to arbitration because he didn't have access to those terms when he bought the software. Using traditional offer and acceptance analysis the customer would say terms occurred when customer bought software from Gateway over the phone. That was the contract.  
- **Did a party make an offer?** Gateway made an offer when they said what they were selling, the customer said they'd purchase it, and Gateway said they'd send it. Customer calls in and gateway makes the offer by saying we promise to sell you the software for x amount of money - the mode of acceptance is exclusive - basically by using the goods/exercising dominion over the goods - or by silence over 30 days. The way courts interpret this is that the only way to accept is to use the software or be silent for 30 days (the way these shrink wrap agreements work is there is a conspicuous notice on the outside of the software that says that the terms are inside the package).
- **Policy:** Gateway would argue that in terms of policy this is reasonable because if these 30 days did not constitute acceptance we would be in a perpetual state of uncertainty as to whether the products were sold; this is what is necessary for markets to function. Gateway would argue that providing terms and conditions over the phone is not good policy because nobody is going to wait on the phone while Gateway reads the contract. Thirty days contracts tend to be waivers of warranty, limitation of liability, mandatory arbitration. These type of shrink wrap contracts might not be enforceable if our societies decided that they were not wanted. Courts make an argument with thirty day acceptance based on policy.

## Revocation prior to acceptance

There are Four ways to terminate an offer. These are:

1. Rejection - only the offeree can reject - would a reasonable person in the offeree's situation ...
2. Revocation - the offeror can revoke the offer
3. Lapse - the offer can lapse. I made offer you said nothing; it's no longer reasonable to understand the offer is still open. What is a reasonable period of time? If oral offer, the offer lapses as soon as the conversation is over. If written, it is a reasonable period of time; if it's a big thing it can take longer
4. Death or incapacity of either party - an offer is not transferable; if the person who made the offer passes away, the offer is over.

Revocation is the tricky one. Starting rule: the offeror can revoke at any time prior to acceptance.

**Dickinson v. Dodds**

- **Facts:**
- 6/10:  Offer
- 6/11 (morning): Dickinson decides to accept
- 6/11 (afternoon):  Dodds sells property to Allen
- Later Dickinson was informed that Dodds sold property to Allen
- 6/11 (evening): Dickinson leaves formal acceptance letter with Dodds’ mother-in-law
- 6/12 (morning):  Dodds receives Dickinson’s acceptance
- Dodds made a valid revocation (he actually got lucky).
- **Rule:** The offeror can revoke at any time before acceptance even if the offeror promises not to revoke. However, the offeror cannot revoke after acceptance. (Contract law doesn't value promises. Contract law only values promises that are an exchange, which makes them a contract.) For an offer to be revoked, the offeree must get actual notice of the revocation, and the notice must be reliable information, but the notice of revocation does not have to come directly from thhe offeror.
- **Policy:** No one is bound until there is mutuality. Also, at the core of contract law is the exchange of goods valued by the Neoclassical economic theory.

Revocation made to the public by an ad: 1. the fine print; 2.

Hypo

How can offeror revoke an offer made by a newspaper ad, poster, or other general notification to the public?

Post a new advertisement. If II make an offer through an advertisement to revoke the offer i would want to put it out in the same publication to reacch roughly the same auddiencce. Even though I ccant giive actual notiicce to every person iif I make a good attempt aandd put the advertisement in the same publication.

BUT I don't have to use the same mode or medium to revoke an offer. It's only if it goes to the general public.

REVOCATION

Offeror can revoke any time prior to acceptance EVEN IF she promised not to revoke  UNLESS:

- Option K:  Additional consideration (exchange) plus signed writing  (§§ 25, 87(1))
- Or
- Firm Offer (UCC § 2-205):  Doesn’t require additional consideration if:
- Signed writing
- By a merchant

Then: Irrevocable during the time stated OR reasonable time BUT not longer than 3 months.

(UCCC is a legal realiist code written by legal realist iin the 1950s trying to make the code reflect real human experience)

WE'VE SEEN TWO THINGS WITH UCCC:

UCC RULE DOES NOT FOLLOW MIRROR IMAGE RULE
UNDER UCCC, IF THE SELLER PUTS IT IN WRITING AND THE SELLER IS A MERCHANT AND WRITES DOWN I PROMISE TO KEEP OFFER OPEN UNTIL JUNE 12TH THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO MAKE THE OFFER IRREVOCABLE. THE COMMON LAW DOESN'T HAVE THIS RULE.

We're only talking about offer and acceptance right now. For it to be a binding contract, you also need consideration.

You don't have a contract until you have the third element, which is consideration.

Two additional ways an offer ccan become irrevoccable is in the Drennan case. This is the third way an offer ccan become irrevocable:

**Drennan v. Star Paving Co.**

D made an offer
P used it to submit its bid
D revoked before P could say “I accept”
Valid revocation?

If the D had the right to revoke and they revoked properly, the revocation occurred before the plaintiff accepted. If the D didn't have the right to revoke or didn't revoke properly then there was no revocation.

Here, there was no revocation because the plaintiff relied on the defendant

From Drennan, if the offeree reasonably relies on the offer to theiir detriment, then the offer becomes irrevocable.

Here, the general contractor had to rely on the subcocntractor's offer to include it in their offer to the schcool. So iif the subconracctor were able to revoke their offer at this late date, then the general cocntracctor would be harmed. they reliied on it and their reliance was reasonable.

The plaintifff is a general contractor preparing to make a bid for a school contract. but thhey need to subcontract. they soliciit a subccontractor. the plaintiff willl accept the lowest bid from a subccontracctor and inccorporate that into theiir bid to the school. lowest bid was $7000 and they submit it. General contractor gets the job. Go back to tell the subcontractor I accept your bid. But before they can saay I accept, the defendant (the subccontracctor) revokes. Why didn't the general contractor accept right away? because they were waiting to see if they got the main job they were putting a bid in for.

How would the analysis be different if the bid were substantially lower than all the other bids? It would not be reasonable. If they had left a 0 out or something it wouldn't be a reasonable bid.

How is reliance on an offer that’s part of an exchange different from reliance on a promise to give a gift?

In most cases, it's not reasonable to rely on an offer. It's not reasonable to rely on an offer. It's very rare for a court to find that reliance on an offer is reasonable. Drennan case is reasonable reliance making the offer irrevocable.

Subrule is that usually, it's not reasonable to rely on an offer and usually the only time a court will find reliancce reasonable is when a contractor's bid reliies on the bid of a subcontractor. Drennan.  

**Revocaation rules:**

Offeror can revoke any time prior to acceptance EVEN IF she promised not to revoke  UNLESS:

Option K:  Additional consideration (exchange) plus signed writing (§ 87(1))

Firm Offer (UCC § 2-205):  Doesn’t require additional consideration.  Just signed writing by merchant…

Reasonable Reliance (Drennan) (§ 87(2))

Part Performance of Unilateral K (§ 45)

FOURTH WAY A CONTRACT BECOMES IRREVOCABLE:

Part performance of a unilateral K

Offer becomes irrevocable.
Part perf does not amount to acceptance.
Acceptance does not occur until full performance.
But offeror has to give offeree reasonable amount of time to complete performance.
What constitutes part performance?

I'll pay you $100 if you paint my fence. Part performance does not amount to acceptance.

Subrules:

What constitutes part performance?  

Usually:
Beginning of performance is required, not just mere preparation
But doesn’t need to be substantial performance – can be just the very start of performance

Once you have painted at least one slat, then you have tried to accept and I have to give you time to fully acccept with full performance.

Hypos

After losing my valuable watch at school I offer a reward to anyone who finds it and returns it.  Some students begin looking around the classroom. Can I revoke?

Yeah. Courts would say that findiing the watch doesn't require a lot of effort so looking iisnt beginning performeance. maybe delivering the watch wouldd be part performance.

naah see rule

I invite someone from California to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge for a reward.  They fly here but haven’t gotten to the bridge yet.  Can I revoke?

What constitutes part performance?

Usually:
Beginning of performance is required, not just mere preparation
But doesn’t need to be substantial performance – can be just the very start of performance

# Consideration

The doctrine of consideration requires that the exchange of promises between parties be based on notions of fairness, reliance, and efficiency. For a contract to be enforceable, in addition to their being assent (offer and acceptance), there must be consideration. For a court to find that there was consideration in promises exchanged, each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and must be given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. A fundamental principle in contract law, coming from Neo-classical economic theory, is that courts do not like to intervene in the adequacy of the deal and assume that both parties are acting rationally, freely and reasonably, and that they agree on the price.

Courts do not examine adequacy of consideration. However, nominal consideration (false or sham motive) is not good consideration. While consideration must be sufficient (there must be a bargained-for exchange of promises), courts do not look at adequacy. Instead, courts assume that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests, and further assumes that the court’s assumption that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests encourages the free flow of commerce. The bargain theory thus permits sellers to charge what the market will "bear" even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites, assuming that if individuals from these groups agree to pay more for goods this is because they want to pay that much, not because they need the goods. To determine whether there was consideration, courts perform a two-step analysis using the paradigms of legal detriment and bargained-for.

**RULE:** Both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

Note: Consideration is the standard analysis for both common law and UCC.

History: In the 16th century contracts were enforced when the court could find any motive for entering into a contract. Every time there was an understandable motive for entering into the contract, the contract should be enforced. In the late 1800s and early 1900s consideration doctrine shifted to look for the inducement. Courts were looking at the benefits and detriments of the contract for the parties. In the benefit-detriment test, both parties have to receive a benefit and incur a detriment. Now it has shifted back to motive, but to the very specific motive of getting the return promise. For example, if I sell you a car for money, my motive (or my consideration) has to be getting the money. Your motive has to be getting the car.

**Breakdown:**

- Each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- Given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- Legal Detriment

(two-step analysis: 1st party has to be making their promise so as to get the return promise; 2nd party has to be making their promise so as to get the return promise)

## Consideration steps of analysis

Two elements:

1. Legal detriment (IRAC)
2. Bargained-for (IRAC)

NOW WE ARE CALLING OFFEROR AND OFFEREE PROMISSOR AND PROMISSEE!

---

### 1. Legal Detriment

I: The first sub-issue is whether there was legal detriment.

R: For there to be legal detriment, both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

Sub-Rule 1: Legal detriment can take several forms [only write the sub-rule I am going to apply]:

- A promise to do something you have a legal right not to do.
- Presently doing something you have a legal right not to do [this would be in a unilateral contract situation - make sure analyzed unilateral in acceptance].
- Promising to forbear from doing something you have a legal right to do.
- Forbearing from something you have a legal right to do.
- Abandoning a legal right
- Limiting freedom of action in future (e.g., renouncing the right to sue, entering into covenants)
- Promise to a third party is included

Sub-rule 2: Both parties must incur a legal detriment.[Analyze legal detriment from both sides!!!!!]

**Landmark case for legal detriment:** *Hamer v. Sidway*   

*Hamer v. Sidway* is no longer good law in part 2 because they use the benefit-detriment test (now we use the bargained-for test), but it is excellent law in part 1 (legal detriment).

In *Hamer v. Sidway,* there was legal detriment to Nephew because he promised not to drink or smoke until he turned 21, which Nephew had a legal right to do. [facts make this a promise to forbear from sub-rule 1] In *Hamer v. Sidway,* there was legal detriment to Uncle because he promised to give Nephew $5,000 if he not drink or smoke until age 21, which Uncle had a legal right not to do. In this analysis, both parties are promisors and promisees.

**U.S. v. Betty Jo Meadors** 	

### 2. Bargained-For

I can think of bargained-for as having two very small IRACs

RST Section 71

Must be bargained for:

- sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- both parties must be making their promise so as to get the return promise

1. Party A has to be making their promise so as to get Party B's return promise.
2. Party B also has to be making their promise so as to get Party A's return promise.  

1. [Party A] made/didn't make their promise [to do something] so as to get [Party B's] return promise of [doing something].
2. [Party B] made/didn't make their promise [to do something] so as to get [Party A's] return promise of [doing something].

**Or, if unilateral:**

1. [Party A] made/didn't make their promise [to do something or to do their performance] so as to get [Party B's] return promise of [doing something or performance of something] [because [facts]].
2. [Party B] made/didn't make their promise [to do something or to do their performance] so as to get [Party A's] return promise of [doing something or performance of something] [because [facts]].

If consideration fails the contract is not enforceable.

**Example hypo from skills**

Laura didn't paint the painting so as to get Prof Z's return promise of $500 because Laura gave Prof. Z the painting before Prof. Z. promised to give Laura $500.

Prof. Z didn't promise the give $500 to Laura so as to get Laura's return promise of painting the painting because Laura had already painted the painting before Prof Z. promised to give Laura $500.

SUB-RULE 1: Courts do not examine **adequacy** of consideration. However, **nominal** consideration is not good consideration. While consideration must be **sufficient**, courts do not look at adequacy.

SUB-RULE 1, LONGER AND MORE COMPLETE: Courts do not examine **adequacy** of consideration. However, **nominal** consideration is not good consideration. While consideration must be **sufficient**, courts do not look at adequacy because their policy is based on neo-classical economic theory, which assumes that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests, and further assumes that the assumption that parties are acting rationally in their own best interests encourages the free flow of commerce. The bargain theory thus permits sellers to charge what the market will "bear" even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites, assuming that if individuals from these groups agree to pay more for goods this is because they want to, not because they have limited choice and need the goods.  

- Adequate (gross inadequacy however is potentially a way in which the courts might invalidate a contract)
- Nominal (a pretext; a lie)
- Sufficient (means that it's bargained for; that both parties are doing the action - making the promises - to get the other thing)

Things that will potentially destroy consideration:

- Mixed motive
- Past consideration
- Gift
- Nominal
- Pre-existing duty rule (police officer returning a person who was whatever)
- Illusory promises

Legal detriment can take several forms. Legal detriment is not satisfied where there is a **pre-existing duty.** A promise to do something one is already obligated to do is not valid consideration because there is no legal detriment because the promisor does not have a legal right not to do it. Pre-existing duty can arise from law. In *Angela White v. Homewood,* the town not promising to administer the physical fitness test did not satisfy legal detriment because the town did not have a legal right not to administer the test. White’s alleged consideration was to take the test; she promised to sign an exculpatory agreement so that she could take the test. The Village promised to allow her to take the test but already had a legal obligation to allow her to take the test, so there is no legal detriment. Therefore, White’s signing of the exculpatory agreement was a gift, and legal detriment fails. Bargained-for also fails, because maybe the town was partly motivated by getting White to sign the agreement, but this doesn’t matter because legal detriment failed. Legal detriment always fails in pre-existing duty.

Legal detriment can take several forms. Legal detriment is not satisfied where there is an **illusory promise**, by which performance is entirely optional. An illusory promise is a promise in form but not in substance. For example, phrases like “I promise to sell you my car unless I decide not to,” “I promise to buy as many bushels of wheat from you as I want,” “I reserve the power to terminate the agreement at any time,” “I will if I want to.” Anything you can imagine that would remove the obligation of the promisor is an illusory promise.  Rules of thumb: “Want” is different from “need” If performance is entirely within one party’s control, it might be illusory, but court will impose obligation of best efforts such as “I promise to use my best efforts to try to get a lease on the property.”

**Restatement §77:** A promise or apparent promise is NOT consideration if by its terms the promisor or purported promisor reserves a choice of alternative performances [retaining right to end “promise” at any time without notice hypo].

IF NO CONSIDERATION, GO TO ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES

**Langer v. Superior Steel Corp.**

- The court held that Langer’s act of refraining from seeking competitive employment constitutes sufficient consideration for an enforceable contract with Superior. Sufficient consideration for an enforceable contract exists when one party agrees to do something or refrains from doing anything that he has a right to do, regardless of whether doing so causes any actual detriment to him or confers any actual benefit upon the other party. [employer awarded $100 pension upon retirement with condition to refrain from competitive employment].

**White v. Village of Homewood (Fire and Police Commission)**  

- The court held that a pre-existing legal duty is not sufficient consideration for a binding contract. Exculpatory contracts/releases are generally enforceable if supported by actual consideration. Consideration cannot consist of an obligation that a party is already legally required to perform and in the present case, the village was legally obligated to administer the test that plaintiff took and sustained injuries from.

# Reliance principle

The reliance principle seeks to protect those who reasonably rely on others. Some maintain that it is reasonable to rely on another person in a variety of different circumstances, while others maintain that it is only reasonable to rely on another person if that person has promised to do something or otherwise voluntarily invited the reliance. As a result of this limitation, the reliance principle in current law emphasizes promises, with the belief that promises should be kept and whether obligation should ever be imposed in the absence of a promise. The reliance principle is corrective or restorative; it holds that a person who has been injured should be compensated for that injury (a corrective or restorative claim). In contrast, the bargain principle is distributive; it holds that the existence of a bargain entitles each person to the benefit he or she expected from the claim (a distributive claim).

# Reliance theory

The reliance theory involves promises to give gifts, and seeks to protect those who reasonably rely on others. *See the reliance principle for longer rule and below for other rule*

Reliance Theory is an alternative ground for recovery when there’s no exchange or no consideration.  Remember that the idea underlying the bargain theory and the doctrine of consideration is based on exchange and the marketplace. In contracts law, the question of whether a promise to give a gift should ever be enforceable is controversial. If we say yes, we’re risking undermining the basis of the bargain theory. One’s view of the bargain theory is really one’s view of consideration; if your view is that consideration is very important, you’re not going to think much of reliance theory. However, if you think that consideration is not always a valid basis for enforcing promises because sometimes although there is no consideration, people might rely on a promise and that’s valuable.  

The family context is very private so that’s a place the court might not intervene – but there’s a whole school of thought that says that promises even in the family sphere and in the private sphere have value and should be enforced.  

Reliance Theory based on:

1. A person who is injured ought to be compensated for that injury (in some cases)
2. One who causes harm ought to be accountable for it

Assumptions

- People do rely on each other
- Such reliance is morally and politically valuable
- Reliance theory doesn’t protect promises – it protects reliance. – (not all promises are enforceable; the rules are not protecting promises; however, once the other party reasonably relies on the promise, you can’t take it back)

### Rule for Recovery Under Reliance Theory

(Promissory estoppel) (§ 90)** (these are Zalesne’s elements - Elements (section 90 is not worded in this way).

1. PROMISE (objective test) – rule is objective test; would a reasonable person think they were making a promise
2. RELIANCE - on the promise (change of position) – change of position because of the promise – I wasn’t going to go to college but you made a promise so based on promise I’m going to go. –
3. REASONABLE - Reliance must be REASONABLE (context/factors) - Factors – context – who parties are -
4. HARM - Reliance must have caused HARM (beyond not getting the thing promised) – harm can’t be I promise to give you 5000 dollars and then you feel harmed when you don’t have 5000 dollars. But if you can show that because of the reliance you were harmed. Say I promise you 5000 dollars and you go buy a car – must show that you’re worse off than you were before the promise.

## Promissory estoppel

Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, if a person makes a representation about a fact, in a situation in which another person is likely to rely on the truth of that fact (sometimes in the context of litigation and sometimes in other contexts), then the first person is barred ("estopped") from denying the truth of the fact as he or she stated it. (45)

Courts may enforce a promise that is not part of an exchange under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, codified in RST § 90(1) which states that "a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for the breach may be limited as justice requires." A promise is defined as "a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made." RST § 2(1). The focus of promissory estoppel is on the circumstances of trust, so the requirement of a promise is shaped by a court's views about the social dimension of trust. Some courts insist that reliance cannot be expected or reasonable unless the promise is "clear and unambiguous." Other courts find that mere "representations" can be sufficient expressions of commitment to induce expected and reasonable reliance.   

## Flexible approach and strict view

**Flexible approach**

- Promise triggering reliance doesn’t have to be as comprehensive as an offer.
- Parties don’t always expressly state things, but reasonable people might still rely.
- The contract model is inadequate to evaluate trust in situations of power inequity / dependency

**Strict Approach** (fear that the reliance theory will take over the bargain theory)

- Promise must be as definite, comprehensive, and unequivocal as an offer.
- If there’s no offer, then there’s no promise.
- As Promissory estoppel is an alternative theory, we don’t want to allow it to completely negate the requirement of consideration.

To really understand promissory estoppel, you have to look at the interplay between the bargain theory and reliance theory. We saw a real limitation to the bargain theory in Childess, where ... *State Bank of Standish v. Curry* is the perfect example of the power dynamics between the bank and the family farm. There is a huge imbalance where the Bank says “we’ll take care of you” and the farmers have to trust. A flexible court sees the value of trust – the importance of trust when there is a power imbalance – and that is the approach the court took in Standish.  

Flexible Approach is most commonly seen in cases of deals-that-never-happen. In these cases, each side pays its own reliance costs. The court has to make sure reliance is reasonable when there is reliance despite the lack of a deal (when a deal is anticipated). The court looks at the words, and the relations of the parties. Lender-borrower; banker-farmer: dependency, trust, stronger party, weaker party. In Standish, the bank should really expect that the Currys would think that the bank was making a promise where in direct response to the Stanfords’ questions the bank said “don’t worry, we will support you;” this is similar to Embry, where Embry asked whether he still had a job and McKittrich said, “don’t worry, get your men out.” In Standish the bank similarly didn’t use direct words of promise but spoke in direct response to the Currys' question, and in the context of a year after year relationship where they always rolled over from year to year so the terms were generally understood.

## Steps of analysis reliance theory

Four elements – argue from one perspective, argue from another, and then the more complicated is the approach – flexible or strict.

### Cases

**Ricketts v. Scothorn**

In Ricketts v. Scothorn, Judge Sullivan applied the idea of equitable estoppel to a promise, instead of a statement of fact. So under Ricketts, if a person says, in effect, "I will do this," in a situation in which reliance is reasonable and foreseeable, he or she may later be estopped from saying "I will not do this" or "my promise is not enforceable."

Facts and finding: In Ricketts, a grandfather promised granddaughter he’d pay her $2000 + 6% interest, The granddaughter quit her job and didn’t work for a year. A year later she got another job. The Grandfather passed away and had only paid one year’s interest on the note. The court found that the bargain principle does not apply and that there was no contract because there was no quid pro quo.  “Mr. Ricketts made no condition, requirement … nothing in return”

Policy: By evoking the estoppel doctrine, Judge Sullivan also evokes the residual judicial power to do "equity" within the body of law called "equity," which is characterized by relatively open claims to justice. (45)

**Kirksey v. Kirksey** (Supreme Court of Alabama 1845) *also in restitution theory!*

In Kirksey v. Kirksey, the court ruled that there was no enforceable promise where the plaintiff's brother-in-law promised plaintiff that if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family." The court reasoned that because the promise was a gift and not an exchange where the plaintiff did not agree to do anything in exchange for living on defendant's farm, which made the promise a gift. The plaintiff argued that there was exchange because she worked on the defendant's farm, which enriched the defendant. Under the reliance theory the promise would have been binding because she relied on the defendant's promise.

**State Bank of Standish v. Curry**

- In *State Bank of Standish v. Curry*, the Currys been borrowing from the bank for ten years. 1983 to 1993. Had outstanding balance of $167,000. Government started buy out program. This would have allowed them to pay their debts if they won the bids. They asked bank if the bank would continue to give them yearly loan. Bank said: “the Currys were doing a great job and had made all their payments and that there was no reason to worry about their future in the dairy business because the bank would support them.” (244) The Bank sues for money owed and Currys sue for promissory estoppel.
- The Currys didn’t bring their case as bargain theory because there was really no offer. The bank’s language was too vague; there were no specific terms. There was only a promise to make an offer in the future. It’s different from I promise to give you a loan for this much if you promise to pay me interest.
- So court says is there is no offer, but there might be a promise. – some courts will use it in a very narrow way. Two views.

# Restitution theory

**Kirksey v. Kirksey** (Supreme Court of Alabama 1845) *also in reliance theory!*

In Kirksey v. Kirksey, the court ruled that there was no enforceable promise where the plaintiff's brother-in-law promised plaintiff that if she would "come down and see [him], [he would] let [her] have a place to raise [her] family." The court reasoned that because the promise was a gift and not an exchange where the plaintiff did not agree to do anything in exchange for living on defendant's farm, which made the promise a gift. Under the restitution theory, which holds that one ought to pay for any benefit unjustly retained, the promise might be binding because there is an argument that the defendant was unjustly enriched.

**Fluffy white dog hypo:** Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals.

- **Answer/rule:** Under the restitution theory, the owner would have to repay me for the out-of-pocket costs I incurred because when somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog there is an obligation to compensate because the dog owner was unjustly enriched.

# Statute of Frauds

Writing need not be formal, but must contain:

If I’m suing you, you have to have signed it. I obviously believe a contract exists because I’m suing you. The question is whether a contract exists. Your signature can be a signature in a very loose context, such as an x, a letterhead, an email, whatever.

The statute of frauds goes back to 16th century England perjury - it aims to stop people from bringing false claims. If words are in writing, you can still commit forgery, but it’s harder to do than perjury. In England, people could not testify on their own behalf. They would get other people to go on the stand, so there was perjury, and the statute of frauds was designed to prevent it. Now people can go on the stand and testify on their own behalf, so in England they felt they didn’t need the statute of frauds and got rid of it. We still have the statute of frauds in the U.S. (with UCC article 2 the statute of frauds in amendments kept being taken out and then being put back in).

The purpose of the statute of frauds is to put things in writing. Also, it’s supposed to prevent compulsive purchases, such as real estate, to encourage people to think before making a really big purchase. The following fall within the statute of frauds (Prof. Zalesne not going to talk about 1 and 3)

2. Ks of suretyship (surety is a person liable for the duty of another person. Both principle and surety are liable to a third person [principal is the original debtor; creditor is the person to whom debt is owned; surety is the promise to pay creditor). A surety contract doesn’t have to be in writing except when there is no consideration. The time that it needs to be in writing is when you agree to guarantee someone. You have to put it in writing because it’s a bit thing to guarantee someone else.
4. K for the sale of land and/or real estate (real property house and land)
6. K for the sale of goods for more than $500 (in the UCC this is the rule and then there are a bunch of exceptions)
5. K for the sale of goods that can’t be performed in one year from the making of the contract (if a promise of either party cannot be performed within one year, the contract has to be in writing. Courts hate this one and if there’s any way to perform this that does not require writing courts will use that.  

**Hypos**

1.	Ten month employment K. Does it need to be in writing? It depends because we don’t know when the contract was signed. If the employment is going to start in September, then its a ten month contract starting in September and if its signed today then the contract is for more than 12 months. It only depends because we didn’t get enough information about when the contract will start; not because things can happen in the future.
2.	K to be performed at a the death of a person. No, doesn’t have to be in writing because a contract that is indefinite in terms does not have to be in writing. (If you want it to be required to be in writing you can make it two years)
3.	A promises to work for B for the rest of A’s life (or the rest of B’s life). Does it need to be in writing? This hypo is identical to the last one. It does not have to be in writing because there is the possibly that a person will die within a year.
4.	Comfort Arms promises to care for Betty for 18 months. Does it need to be in writing? Yes. If Betty passes away before 18 months, contract still exists; performance can be excused, but this does need to be in writing because it can’t be performed in less than a year.
5.	K to build a full-scale replica of empire state building. Does it need to be in writing? No because if a zillion people build it it could be done in less than a year.
6.	K for permanent employment - Does it need to be in writing? if it means until you’re 65 yes you need writing if more vague no
7.	Two year K to sell all the grain you shall need for $100/barrel. Does it need to be in writing? The two-year rule does not apply because it’s the sale of goods. No, because it’s sale of goods and the grain may be sold for less than $500 (person might need fewer than 5 barrels) - there’s no guarantee that I will need at least 5 barrels of grain so no, it probably doesn’t have to be in writing. Because it’s about the sale of goods, the UCC applies. None of the other rules apply. However, some courts might say that based on history, you will need more than 5 barrels so yes, writing is required.
8.	Eight-month K subject to renewal. Does it need to be in writing? No, because at the time of entering contract as the hypo stands, it is less than a year. Other relevant conditions are unknown and could change the facts and analysis.

**EXCEPTION**

Party is estopped from asserting the SOF if full performance (some courts only require partial)

**Hypo: relationship to promissory estoppel**

- P (landlord) and D (tenant) enter into a K
- 2 year lease
- P promises to make renovations first - necessary before D will sign contract
- P makes renovations
- D never moved in and refuses to pay
- No writing. P sues
- What result under bargain theory?
- What result under restitution theory?
- What result under reliance theory?
- The first question is is there an enforceable contract
- The first sub-question is is a writing required? Yes
- Can landlord sue under restitution theory? The landlord can’t sue under restitution because was fixing own property; tenant never moved in so landlord never conferred a benefit on tenant.
What result under reliance theory? The landlord is saying that the tenant promised to live in the apartment and pay rent. Tenant says doesn’t apply because not in writing. That would have worked under bargain theory. The question under reliance theory is landlord saying you promised to live here, I relied on it. I made the renovations. I’m harmed. (Maybe not harmed). Here landlord could say I made the renovations in reliance on your promise. In a strict court you would lose anyway. You didn’t put it in writing. A flexible court would say that the bargain theory failed because the tenant promised that if landlord did renovations, they would sign contract, so the landlord had to do renovations.
