## Charles R Embry v Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods Company

Missouri Court of Appeals 105 S.W. 777 (1907) (pp 59-66)

- **Purpose:** Illustrates objective theory of interpretation (reasonable person)
- **Issue:** Whether the appellant and the respondent entered into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Partiesâ€™ Arguments:**
-	 Charles Embry ("the appellant") is arguing that following the expiration of his employment contract at Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Company ("the respondent" or "the respondent company") he was reemployed by McKittrick, the president of the respondent company ("the respondent company president" or "the president") to work for another year at the same compensation and with the same duties.  
-	The respondent is arguing that the respondent company president never reemployed the appellant following the termination of the appellant's written contract on 12/15/1903.  
- **Procedural History:** The case had been tried once and appealed, and then retried and here is appealed again.
- **Facts:** The respondent is a wholesale dry goods company. The appellant was employed by the respondent under a written contract to select samples for traveling salesmen. The contract expired on 12/15/1903. Appellant continued to work past this date and on 12/23/1903 he went into the respondent company president's office. According to appellant, on 12/23/1903 he told the respondent company president that his contract had expired eight days before and if he wanted to continue to employ appellant he would have to give the appellant a contract for another year, and that the respondent company president responded "Go ahead, you're all right. Get your men out, and don't let that worry you." (60) The respondent company president does not dispute that the appellant went into the president's office but stated that he said "I have no time to take it up now. I have told you before I would not take it up until I have these matters out of the way. You will have to see me at a later time. ... Go back upstairs and get your men out on the road." (61-62)  On 2/15/1904 respondent notified appellant that his employment would be terminated on 3/1/1904 because the company needed to retrench expenses. On 3/1/1904 appellant was discharged.  
- **Rule:** If the words or acts of two parties would be understood by a reasonable person to manifest the intention of both parties to enter into a contract, a contract is created, regardless of whether a party did not intend to enter into the contract so long as a reasonable person would find that the inner intention is not embodied in the words used by or acts of the parties. (62 4th para)
- **Holding:** The appellant and the respondent did enter into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Judgment:** Reversed, cause remanded.
- **Reasoning:** At trial, the jury was instructed that if they found that in their conversation on 12/23/1903 both parties expressed the intent to contract with the other party for the plaintiff's employment for one year from and including 12/23/1903, they should find that the parties thereby entered into a contract. At appeal, the court questioned whether this jury instruction was a correct statement of law, asking whether the formation of a contract depended on the intention of the then plaintiff and the then defendant or on the words spoken by both parties. (62) The court reasoned that the creation of a contract depended on the words spoken by the parties as they would be understood by a reasonable person. (63) The court found that a if what McKittrick said would be taken by a reasonable person in Embry's situation (Embry had just told his employer that they needed to be reemployed for another year or otherwise would leave) to be an assent to Embry's request, they constituted a valid contract of employment for the ensuing year.       
- **Comments:** I'm not sure I understand why the court found McKittrick said what Embry said he said.

## RLM Dist Co v WA Taylor Inc

- **Purpose:** Illustrates objective theory of interpretation
- **Issue:**
- **Rule:** Basic contract law does not require that agreements be made exclusively through verbal or written communications. Agreements can be implied in whole or in part through conduct alone or through usage of trade. *See RST Contracts Section 4* An implied agreement concerning the issue of transferability may arise in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary if custom or practice in the industry provides for such an understanding.
- **Holding:** The court found that custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement between the parties.
