## Kirksey v. Kirksey

Supreme Court of Alabama 8 Ala. 131 (1845)

- **Issue:** If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children?
- **Facts:** Anne and several children lived on a homesteading claim on public land. Anne got a letter from her brother-in-law that said “Dear sister Anne, I felt terrible upon learning of brother Henry’s death. I do not know if you have a preference on the place you are living on, but if you do, I would advise you to sell the land. If you come down to see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; on account of your situation, and that of your family, I feel I want you and the children to do well. Your brother-in-law, Henry.” Anne abandoned her homestead, moved into a house provided by Henry and began to farm his land. At first he put her and her family in a comfortable house and gave her land to cultivate, but at the end of two years, he notified her to move, and put her in a shack in the woods. He later asked her to move from that as well.
- **Anne’s allegations:** Anne argued that Henry offered her a place to live.
- **Henry’s allegations:** Henry would argue no because although he promised to let Anne “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.
- **Rule/Law:** A promise to provide free land for a residence is a gift, not an exchange, and gifts are not contracts, so it is not a contract.
- **Holding:** The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract.

## Charles R Embry v Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods Company

Missouri Court of Appeals 105 S.W. 777 (1907) (pp 59-66)

- **Purpose:** Illustrates objective theory of interpretation (reasonable person)
- **Issue:** Whether the appellant and the respondent entered into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Parties’ Arguments:**
-	 Charles Embry ("the appellant") is arguing that following the expiration of his employment contract at Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Company ("the respondent" or "the respondent company") he was reemployed by McKittrick, the president of the respondent company ("the respondent company president" or "the president") to work for another year at the same compensation and with the same duties.  
-	The respondent is arguing that the respondent company president never reemployed the appellant following the termination of the appellant's written contract on 12/15/1903.  
- **Procedural History:** The case had been tried once and appealed, and then retried and here is appealed again.
- **Facts:** The respondent is a wholesale dry goods company. The appellant was employed by the respondent under a written contract to select samples for traveling salesmen. The contract expired on 12/15/1903. Appellant continued to work past this date and on 12/23/1903 he went into the respondent company president's office. According to appellant, on 12/23/1903 he told the respondent company president that his contract had expired eight days before and if he wanted to continue to employ appellant he would have to give the appellant a contract for another year, and that the respondent company president responded "Go ahead, you're all right. Get your men out, and don't let that worry you." (60) The respondent company president does not dispute that the appellant went into the president's office but stated that he said "I have no time to take it up now. I have told you before I would not take it up until I have these matters out of the way. You will have to see me at a later time. ... Go back upstairs and get your men out on the road." (61-62)  On 2/15/1904 respondent notified appellant that his employment would be terminated on 3/1/1904 because the company needed to retrench expenses. On 3/1/1904 appellant was discharged.  
- **Rule:** If the words or acts of two parties would be understood by a reasonable person to manifest the intention of both parties to enter into a contract, a contract is created, regardless of whether a party did not intend to enter into the contract so long as a reasonable person would find that the inner intention is not embodied in the words used by or acts of the parties. (62 4th para)
- **Holding:** The appellant and the respondent did enter into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Judgment:** Reversed, cause remanded.
- **Reasoning:** At trial, the jury was instructed that if they found that in their conversation on 12/23/1903 both parties expressed the intent to contract with the other party for the plaintiff's employment for one year from and including 12/23/1903, they should find that the parties thereby entered into a contract. At appeal, the court questioned whether this jury instruction was a correct statement of law, asking whether the formation of a contract depended on the intention of the then plaintiff and the then defendant or on the words spoken by both parties. (62) The court reasoned that the creation of a contract depended on the words spoken by the parties as they would be understood by a reasonable person. (63) The court found that a if what McKittrick said would be taken by a reasonable person in Embry's situation (Embry had just told his employer that they needed to be reemployed for another year or otherwise would leave) to be an assent to Embry's request, they constituted a valid contract of employment for the ensuing year.       
- **Comments:** I'm not sure I understand why the court found McKittrick said what Embry said he said.

## RLM Dist Co v WA Taylor Inc

723 F. Supp. 421 (D. Ariz. 1988)

- **Purpose:** Illustrates objective theory of interpretation
- **Rule:** Basic contract law does not require that agreements be made exclusively through verbal or written communications. Agreements can be implied in whole or in part through conduct alone or through usage of trade. *See RST Contracts Section 4* An implied agreement concerning the issue of transferability may arise in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary if custom or practice in the industry provides for such an understanding.
- **Holding:** The court found that custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement between the parties.

## United Steelworkers of America Local 1330 v US Steel

USDC for the Northern District of Ohio, 492 F. Supp. 1 (1980)

- **Issue:** Did U.S. Steel's statements represent a promise made by the corporation on which the workers should have reasonably relied?
- **Facts:** U.S. Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable. Workers gave up furloughs and extra pay in order to keep the company profitable. The company was profitable but closed anyway.
- **Workers' allegations:** communications by the company constitute a promise to keep the factory operating if and so long as the mills are profitable.
- **U.S. Steel’s allegations:** U.S. Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable. The statement that lack of profitability would close the plants does not imply that the plants will not close if they are profitable.
- **Rule/Law:**
- **Holding:** U.S. Steel's statements did not represent a promise made by the corporation on which the workers should have reasonably relied.
- **Summary/notes:** You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.

## John D.R. Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.

U.S. District Court, SDNY (1999)  

- **Issue:** Whether accepting the terms of an advertisement that is not clear and intended to be a joke can create an enforceable contract.
- **Facts:**
- **I. Uncontested facts:** Pepsico was going to run a promotional campaign called "Pepsi Stuff" which encouraged consumers to collect points from Pepsi packaging and redeem them for Pepsi branded merchandise. Before launching the campaign, to test the promotion, Pepsico broadcast a TV commercial that showed someone redeeming their points for a Harrier jet. Pepsico also distributed a Pepsi Stuff catalog in Washington State which listed various items exchangeable for points but not the Harrier jet. An order form that came with the catalog had check boxes for ordering the items advertised in the catalog but not the Harrier jet. The catalog stated that merchandise could only be ordered with the order form.
- **II. Appellant Leonard’s factual allegations:** Plaintiff Leonard alleged that he saw the commercial with the Harrier jet and based on the commercial, believed that he could redeem 7.000.000 Pepsi Stuff points for a Harrier jet. Through collecting and buying points for this purpose, Leonard amassed about 700,000 points.
- **III. Respondent Pepsico’s factual allegations:** Defendant Pepsico alleged that the advertisement in the commercial stating that the Harrrier jet could be purchased with 7,000,000 Pepsi Stuff points was a joke.
- IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:
- Procedural History:
- Court’s Reasoning:
- **Rule/Law:** For an advertisement to be an offer, there must be some language of commitment (on whose part?) or some invitation to take action without further communication (could this invitation to take action be an order form?). (99) Advertisements are mere requests to consider and examine and negotiate unless the circumstances are exceptional and the words used are very plain and clear. (99) An advertisement is not transformed into an enforceable offer merely by a potential offeree's expression of willingness to accept the offer through, among other means, completion of an order form. (99) Advertisements and the completion of order forms are mere notices and solicitations for offers. (99) Purchase orders are not enforceable contracts until they are accepted by the seller (99-100). RST § 26 states that "[a] manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has madde a further manifestation of assent" (100).
- Application:
- Policy:
- Holding: Here, the court found that it was not an offer.
- Disposition:
- Context (why the case was assigned):

## Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus

(discussed in Pepsi)

- Facts: Great Minneapolis Surplus Store published advertisement stating that on Saturday at 9 AM sharp 3 coats would be sold at a very low price.
- Rule/Law: An advertisement may constitute a contract if it is clear, definite and explicit, and leaves nothing open to negotiation.
- Application: Because the coat ad was clear, definite and explicit, it was an offer. Lefkowitz accepted the offer by going to the store at the specific time with the money.

## Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co

(discussed in Pepsi)

- Issue: Whether there was an enforceable contract between Carbolic Smoke Ball and the viewers of the ad when Carbolic Smoke Ball when it placed an ad stating that the company would give £100 to anyone who used the product and still got the flu.
- Rule/Law: Advertisements offering rewards are offers to anyone who does perform the conditions named in the advertisement, and anybody who does perform the condition accepts the offer.  
- Application: Factors:
- Invites performance.
- Extravagant promise: If a person chooses to make extravagant promises, it usually benefits them to make such a promise.
- Communicates a willingness to commit: I have money in the bank stored away ready to pay you; this is a real offerr beccause ii have money.
- Holding/illustration: In Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., the court found that an ad was an offer because by stating that the company would give £100 to anyone who used the product and still got the flu, the advertiser invited performance by inviting the public to prove it wrong and communicated a willingness to commit by promising a reward if they did.

## Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Nowlin Smith, Jr.

Wyoming Supreme Court 637 P.2d 1020 (1981)

- **Issues:** Whether Smith accepted Panhandle's offer to withdraw Smith's discharge even though Smith added words to Pandandle's letter of discharge. (2) Whether the words Smith wrote on the letter were acceptance or a counteroffer.
- **Panhandle's allegations:** (1) Panhandle's mode of acceptance of its offer excluded all other modes of acceptance including writing any words on the letter of discharge. (2) By writing on the letter of discharge Smith made a counteroffer.
- **Holding:** (1) The court found that the requirement that Smith not write on the letter is unreasonable because the only reason the court surmised that Panhandle could have for stipulating that Smith not write on the letter was "an inordinate fondness for tidy sheets of paper." Unreasonable requirements must be specified in the communicated offer. (2) Smith accepted Panhandle's offer to withdraw Smith's discharge even though Smith aded words to the letter of discharge because the notes that Smith wrote on the letter were "grumbling" and were not a modification of the offer. The court found that the term added by Smith that he be able to view his personnel file were implicit in the offer because by CBA all employees had a right to view their personnel file. Therefore, this condition was not a new term that modified the contract and was thus not a counteroffer.
- **Rule/Law:** (1) An offeror has the right to accept an exclusive mode of acceptance from an offeree. An exclusive mode of acceptance can be unreasonable or difficult if it clearly excludes all other modes of acceptance, and this intention is expressed in the communicated offer itself. (2) An acceptance is still effective if the addition only asks for something that would be implied from the offer and is therefore immaterial. (p. 109)

## Russel v. Texas Co.

U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, 238 F.2d 636 (1956)

- **Issue:** Whether an offeree may vitiate a contract by a claim of lack of intention to accept an offer when he accepts and retains the benefits offered to him by the offeror, with a positive and affirmative proviso by the offeror that such acceptance of the benefits will, in and of itself, be deemed by the offeror to be an acceptance. (p. 115)
- **Narrow Issue:** Whether Texas Co. accepted Russel's offer of a revocable license for use of real property section 23.
- **Facts:**
- **I. Uncontested facts:** Russell's predecessors acquired section 23 from the Northern Pacific Railway Company through a contract in 1918. In the contract and deed were miniral rights. The Texas Co. conducted operations in section 23 since 1952 under an oil and gas lease granted by Norrthern Pacific Railway Company. The Texas Co. has also made use of the surface of section 23.   
- **II. Appellant Russel’s factual allegations:** Russel argued that its offer of a license to Texas Co. stated that the continued use of section 23 constituted acceptance.  
- **III. Respondent Texas Co.’s factual allegations:** Texas Co. argued that it never accepted Russel's offer of a revocable license for the use of section 23 because Texas Co. did not intend to accept this offer.
- **IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:**
- **Procedural History:** Russell sued Texas Co. for nonpayment in trial court. The trial court found that Texas Co. had accepted Russel's offer of a revocable contract and ruled that Texas Co. should therefore pay Russell damages. Texas Co. appealed.  
- **Court’s Reasoning:** See application below.
- **Rule/Law:** Under RST § 72.2 "Where the offeree exercises dominion over things which are offered to him, such exercise of dominion in the absence of other circumstances showing a contrary intention is an acceptance, though the offeree manifests an intention not to accept.""
- **Application:** The court applied the reasonable person test which asks whether or not the offeror was led to reasonably believe that the act of the offeree was an acceptance; the court found that in this case, it was. (p. 116)
- **Policy:**
- **Holding:** An offeree may vitiate a contract by a claim of lack of intention to accept an offer when he accepts and retains the benefits offered to him by the offeror, with a positive and affirmative proviso by the offeror that such acceptance of the benefits will, in and of itself, be deemed by the offeror to be an acceptance.
- **Disposition:** Judgement affirmed as to appelants.
- **Context (why the case was assigned):** To illustrate acceptance by silence.

## Nguyen v. Barnes and Noble, Inc.  

U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit 763 F.3d 1171 (2014)

- **Issue:** Whether a person can agree to a company's terms and conditions by visiting any area of that company's website (this was a class action suit. Nguyen and all others similarly situated)
- **Facts:** Barnes & Noble's website’s terms of use said that "By visiting any area in the Barnes & Noble.com site, creating an account, or making a purchase, a User is deemed to have accepted the Terms of Use." The terms of use state that claims shall not be consolidated (you cannot bring a class action) and any disputes will be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration can be a good way of dispute resolution but is also a problem because when you agree to not go to trial - when you agree to mandatory arbitration - you are waiving your constitutional rights to a jury trial. Studies have shown that arbitration heavily favors corporations over individuals and employers over employees.
- **Policy:** Mandatory arbitration is a huge thing in contract law. Repeat performance: the Company is going to keep going back to arbitration, and the arbitrator is chosen by the parties so they have every reason to please them. Arbitration has fewer restrictions and rules than court and it often results in the consumer losing. When you're buying something online you're not going to negotiate terms. when you're getting hired you're not going to want to displease.
- **Nguyen argued** that he is not bound by the arbitration clause because he never signed anything. He says he never clicked I agree and never even saw the contract, thus, he had no notice of the terms.
- **Barnes & Nobles argued** that the contract is posted on their website so Nguyen had constructive notice of the contract. this is like when you click or not. it doesn't matter because if the person wants to know terms they are findable.  
- **Rule:** The mere presence of a link without some obvious prompt to take affirmative action is not sufficient to bind a user to an arbitration agreement described in terms and conditions. The user must have actual or constructive knowledge of the websites terms and conditions. Visiting the website is not enough. The onus is on the website owner to provide the user with actual or constructive knowledge that by visiting the website the user agrees to the terms and conditions hyperlinked to the website.
- **Application:** The court uses basic offer and acceptance terms and finds that you need a mutual manifestation of intent. The court finds that if you click around on the website that indicates assent.
- **Holding:** The browsewrap agreement did not give Nguyen sufficient notice of Barnes & Nobles's terms and conditions, and Nguyen therefore did not enter into an agreement with Barnes & Nobles by visiting their website.

## Dickenson v. Dodds  

- **Facts:**
- 6/10:  Offer
- 6/11 (morning): Dickinson decides to accept
- 6/11 (afternoon):  Dodds sells property to Allen
- Later Dickinson was informed that Dodds sold property to Allen
- 6/11 (evening): Dickinson leaves formal acceptance letter with Dodds’ mother-in-law
- 6/12 (morning):  Dodds receives Dickinson’s acceptance
- Dodds made a valid revocation (he actually got lucky).
- **Notes:**
- This offer will be left open until 6/12
- Dickinson tried to accept before 6/12
- Issue is could he revoke; could he change his mind?
- Was the promise to keep the offer open until the 12th binding? For something to be binding it needs sth, sth, and consideration
- If the promise is not binding, I can revoke.
- Promise could have been binding if the offeree had paid money to offeror for keeping the offer open
1. Did Dodds have the right to revoke? Yes.
2. Did Dodds properly revoke the offer before Dickinson acccepted it? Yes.
- If Dodds didn't revoke it would be a mess. If both accepted Dickinson would have to pay damages to Dickinson
- the only question is if Dodd revoked before Dickinson accepted, would they have a contract? Even if there was already a contract with allen.
1. Was there an offer? yes.
2. Was there acceptance? yes
- **Rule:** The offeror can revoke at any time before acceptance even if the offeror promises not to revoke. However, the offeror cannot revoke after acceptance. (Contract law doesn't value promises. Contract law only values promises that are an exchange, which makes them a contract.) For an offer to be revoked, the offeree must get actual notice of the revocation, and the notice must be reliable information, but the notice of revocation does not have to come directly from thhe offeror.
- **Policy:** No one is bound until there is mutuality. Also, at the core of contract law is the exchange of goods valued by the Neoclassical economic theory.
- **Sloppy rule:** If offeree accepts before offeror revokes, it's too late for the offeror to revoke. If offeror revokes before offeree accepts, offeror can revoke.

## Langer v. Superior Steel Corp.   

Superior Court of Pennsylvania 161 A. 571 (1932)

- **Issue:** Whether a promise of an unsolicited retirement pension to an employee was a gift or an enforceable contract. (was the promise supported by a sufficient consideration?)
- **Facts:** Langen was retiring from his position in the Annealing Department of the company.[^1] SCC sent Langer a letter saying it would give him a pension for life of $100 a month so long as he did not go work for another competitive company. Langer received payments for four years and then was informed that payments would stop.
- **Langer alleged** that consideration existed in Langer's *performance* of remaining loyal to SCC and refraining from taking a job withh another company. Langer further argued that the promise was induced by his performance and his performance was induced by the promise, so they were bargained-for.
- **SCC alleged** that its promise to Langer was not enforceable because it was gratuitous, without consideration.
- **The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:** Lower court used Kirskey and ruled that the pension was a mere gratuity.
- **Procedural History:** Langer appealed and filed assumpsit[^2] to recover damages for breach of contract.  
- Court’s Reasoning:
- **Rule/Law:** If the promisor is not benefited by the promise than the promise is more likely a "condition of a gift" than a "consideration of a promise." (Judge Baldridge distinguishing from Kirksey) This line of analysis allows us to distinguish gifts-with-a-condition from promises-with-consideration.
- **Application:** SSC promised to pay Langer a pension of $100 a month and had a legal right not to pay Langer a pension. Langer promised to refrain from being employed in any competitive occupation, and had a legal right to refrain from being in such employment. There was consideration on the part of SCC because SSC stood to benefit from Langer not working for another company, and therefore wanted Langer's promise that he would not work for another company. There was consideration on the part of Langer because he refrained from getting another job in exchange for the promise of $100 a month. So Langer had legal detriment.
- **Policy:**
- **Holding:** Here, the court found that SSC's promise had consideration because there was benefit to be derived by the promisor, and therefore consideration. The court also found that refraining from going to work for another company was legal detriment for Langer so that was his consideration.  
- **Disposition:** Judgment reversed, defendant given permission to file affidavit of defense to plaintiff's claim.

[^1]:In metallurgy and materials science, annealing is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more workable.

[^2]:1.An express or implied promise, not under seal, by which one person undertakes to do some act or pay something to another *an assumpsit to pay a debt*. 2. A common-law action for breach of such a promise or for breach of a contract *the creditor's assumpsit against the debtor*.

## White v. Village of Homewood Fire and Police Commission

Appellate Court of Illinois 628 N.E. 2d 616 (1993)

- Issue: Whether an exculpatory contract was an enforceable contract.
- Facts: White agreed to excculpatory cclause andd basically released them from negligence
- I. Uncontested facts: Angela White, firefighter, took physical agility test. Before test she signed agreement to waive  liability. White fell. Brought negligence claim. Said agreement was unenforceable because she only signed because she needed the job.
- II. Appellant Angela White’s factual allegations: the exculpatory agreement is unenforceable because it lacks consideration and violates public policy.
- III. Respondent Village of Homewood Fire and Police Commission’s factual allegations: In consideration of the exculpatory agreement they administered the physical agility test.
- IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:
- Procedural History:
- Court’s Reasoning:
- Rule/Law: The pre-existing duty rule provides that where a party does what it is already legally obligated to do, there is no consideration as there is no detriment.
- Application:
- Policy: under certain circumstances exculpatory contracts may act as a total bar to a plaintiff's negligence claim because public policy favors freedom to contract.
- Holding:
- Disposition:
- Context (why the case was assigned):

White's alleged consideration was to take the test; she promised to sign the exculpatory agreement so that she could take the test. The Village is promising to allow her to take the test but already has a legal obligation to allow her to take the test, so there is no legal detriment. Therefore, White's signing of the exculpatory agreement is a gift.

Legal detriment fails. Bargained-for also fails, because maybe the town was partly motivated by getting her to sign the agreement, but this doesn't matter beccause legal detriment failed. Legal detriment always fails in pre-existing duty.
