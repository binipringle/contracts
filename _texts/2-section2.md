**Kirksey v. Kirksey** Supreme Court of Alabama 8 Ala. 131 (1845)

- Issue: If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children?
- Facts: Anne is a widow raising several children. She and her children lived on a homesteading claim on public land. Anne received a
letter from her brother-in-law that stated: “Dear sister Anne—I felt terrible upon learning of brother Henry’s death. I do not
know if you have a preference on the place you are living on, but if you do, I would advise you to sell the land. If you come
down to see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; on account of your
situation, and that of your family, I feel I want you and the children to do well. Your brother-in-law, Henry.” Within a month or
two of receiving this letter, Anne abandoned her homestead, moved into a house provided by Henry and began to farm his
land. At first he put her and her family in a comfortable house and gave her land to cultivate, but at the end of two years, he notified her to move, and put her in a shack in the woods. He later asked her to move from that as well.
- II. Anne’s allegations: Anne argued that Henry offered her a place to live.
- III. Henry’s allegations: Henry would argue no because although he promised to let Anne “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.
- IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:
- Procedural History:
- Court’s Reasoning:
- Rule/Law: A promise to provide free land for a residence is a gift, not an exchange, and gifts are not contracts, so it is not a contract.
- Holding: The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract.

## Charles R Embry v Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods Company

Missouri Court of Appeals 105 S.W. 777 (1907) (pp 59-66)

- **Purpose:** Illustrates objective theory of interpretation (reasonable person)
- **Issue:** Whether the appellant and the respondent entered into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Parties’ Arguments:**
-	 Charles Embry ("the appellant") is arguing that following the expiration of his employment contract at Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Company ("the respondent" or "the respondent company") he was reemployed by McKittrick, the president of the respondent company ("the respondent company president" or "the president") to work for another year at the same compensation and with the same duties.  
-	The respondent is arguing that the respondent company president never reemployed the appellant following the termination of the appellant's written contract on 12/15/1903.  
- **Procedural History:** The case had been tried once and appealed, and then retried and here is appealed again.
- **Facts:** The respondent is a wholesale dry goods company. The appellant was employed by the respondent under a written contract to select samples for traveling salesmen. The contract expired on 12/15/1903. Appellant continued to work past this date and on 12/23/1903 he went into the respondent company president's office. According to appellant, on 12/23/1903 he told the respondent company president that his contract had expired eight days before and if he wanted to continue to employ appellant he would have to give the appellant a contract for another year, and that the respondent company president responded "Go ahead, you're all right. Get your men out, and don't let that worry you." (60) The respondent company president does not dispute that the appellant went into the president's office but stated that he said "I have no time to take it up now. I have told you before I would not take it up until I have these matters out of the way. You will have to see me at a later time. ... Go back upstairs and get your men out on the road." (61-62)  On 2/15/1904 respondent notified appellant that his employment would be terminated on 3/1/1904 because the company needed to retrench expenses. On 3/1/1904 appellant was discharged.  
- **Rule:** If the words or acts of two parties would be understood by a reasonable person to manifest the intention of both parties to enter into a contract, a contract is created, regardless of whether a party did not intend to enter into the contract so long as a reasonable person would find that the inner intention is not embodied in the words used by or acts of the parties. (62 4th para)
- **Holding:** The appellant and the respondent did enter into a contract with each other during their conversation on 12/23/1903 for the reemployment of the appellant for one year from that date.
- **Judgment:** Reversed, cause remanded.
- **Reasoning:** At trial, the jury was instructed that if they found that in their conversation on 12/23/1903 both parties expressed the intent to contract with the other party for the plaintiff's employment for one year from and including 12/23/1903, they should find that the parties thereby entered into a contract. At appeal, the court questioned whether this jury instruction was a correct statement of law, asking whether the formation of a contract depended on the intention of the then plaintiff and the then defendant or on the words spoken by both parties. (62) The court reasoned that the creation of a contract depended on the words spoken by the parties as they would be understood by a reasonable person. (63) The court found that a if what McKittrick said would be taken by a reasonable person in Embry's situation (Embry had just told his employer that they needed to be reemployed for another year or otherwise would leave) to be an assent to Embry's request, they constituted a valid contract of employment for the ensuing year.       
- **Comments:** I'm not sure I understand why the court found McKittrick said what Embry said he said.

## RLM Dist Co v WA Taylor Inc

- **Purpose:** Illustrates objective theory of interpretation
- **Issue:**
- **Rule:** Basic contract law does not require that agreements be made exclusively through verbal or written communications. Agreements can be implied in whole or in part through conduct alone or through usage of trade. *See RST Contracts Section 4* An implied agreement concerning the issue of transferability may arise in the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary if custom or practice in the industry provides for such an understanding.
- **Holding:** The court found that custom and practice in the industry was sufficient to imply an agreement between the parties.

**John D.R. Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.** U.S. District Court, SDNY (1999)  

- **Issue:** Whether accepting the terms of an advertisement that is not clear and intended to be a joke can create an enforceable contract.
- **Facts:**
- **I. Uncontested facts:** Pepsico was going to run a promotional campaign called "Pepsi Stuff" which encouraged consumers to collect points from Pepsi packaging and redeem them for Pepsi branded merchandise. Before launching the campaign, to test the promotion, Pepsico broadcast a TV commercial that showed someone redeeming their points for a Harrier jet. Pepsico also distributed a Pepsi Stuff catalog in Washington State which listed various items exchangeable for points but not the Harrier jet. An order form that came with the catalog had check boxes for ordering the items advertised in the catalog but not the Harrier jet. The catalog stated that merchandise could only be ordered with the order form.
- **II. Appellant Leonard’s factual allegations:** Plaintiff Leonard alleged that he saw the commercial with the Harrier jet and based on the commercial, believed that he could redeem 7.000.000 Pepsi Stuff points for a Harrier jet. Through collecting and buying points for this purpose, Leonard amassed about 700,000 points.
- **III. Respondent Pepsico’s factual allegations:** Defendant Pepsico alleged that the advertisement in the commercial stating that the Harrrier jet could be purchased with 7,000,000 Pepsi Stuff points was a joke.
- IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:
- Procedural History:
- Court’s Reasoning:
- **Rule/Law:** For an advertisement to be an offer, there must be some language of commitment (on whose part?) or some invitation to take action without further communication (could this invitation to take action be an order form?). (99) Advertisements are mere requests to consider and examine and negotiate unless the circumstances are exceptional and the words used are very plain and clear. (99) An advertisement is not transformed into an enforceable offer merely by a potential offeree's expression of willingness to accept the offer through, among other means, completion of an order form. (99) Advertisements and the completion of order forms are mere notices and solicitations for offers. (99) Purchase orders are not enforceable contracts until they are accepted by the seller (99-100). RST § 26 states that "[a] manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has madde a further manifestation of assent" (100).
- Application:
- Policy:
- Holding: Here, the court found that it was not an offer.
- Disposition:
- Context (why the case was assigned):

**Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus** (discussed in Pepsi)

- Issue:
- Facts: Great Minneapolis Surplus Store published advertisement stating that on Saturday at 9 AM sharp 3
- I. Uncontested facts:
- II. Appellant NAME’s factual allegations:
- III. Respondent NAME’s factual allegations:
- IV. The appellate court’s resolution of the fact:
- Procedural History:
- Court’s Reasoning:
- Rule/Law: An advertisement may constitute a contract if it is clear, definite and explicit, and leaves nothing open to negotiation.
- Application: Because the coat ad was clear, definite and explicit, it was an offer. Lefkowitz accepted the offer by going to the store at the specific time with the money.
- Policy:
- Holding:
- Disposition:
- Context (why the case was assigned):

**Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co** (discussed in Pepsi)

- Issue: Whether there was an enforceable contract between Carbolic Smoke Ball and the viewers of the ad when Carbolic Smoke Ball when it placed an ad stating that the company would give £100 to anyone who used the product and still got the flu.
- Rule/Law: Advertisements offering rewards are offers to anyone who does perform the conditions named in the advertisement, and anybody who does perform the condition accepts the offer.  
- Application: Factors:
- Invites performance.
- Extravagant promise: If a person chooses to make extravagant promises, it usually benefits them to make such a promise.
- Communicates a willingness to commit: I have money in the bank stored away ready to pay you; this is a real offerr beccause ii have money.
- Holding/illustration: In Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., the court found that an ad was an offer because by stating that the company would give £100 to anyone who used the product and still got the flu, the advertiser invited performance by inviting the public to prove it wrong and communicated a willingness to commit by promising a reward if they did.

**United Steelworkers of America, Local 1330 v. U.S. Steel** USDC for the Northern District of Ohio, 492 F. Supp. 1 (1980)

- Issue: Did U.S. Steel's statements represent a promise made by the corporation on which the workers should have reasonably relied?
- Facts: U.S. Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable. Workers gave up furloughs and extra pay in order to keep the company profitable. The company was profitable but closed anyway.
- I. Uncontested facts:
- II. Worker’s factual allegations: communications by the company constitute a promise to keep the factory operating if and so long as the mills are profitable.
- III. U.S. Steel’s factual allegations: U.S. Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable. The statement that lack of profitability would close the plants does not imply that the plants will not close if they are profitable.
- Rule/Law:
- Holding: U.S. Steel's statements did not represent a promise made by the corporation on which the workers should have reasonably relied.
- Summary/notes: You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.
