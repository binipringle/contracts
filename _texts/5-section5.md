The question is whether Marie, a minor, can void the contract she entered into with Computer Store and, if so, whether she will have to pay restitution where she agreed to purchase and received a computer from Computer Store but failed to make monthly payments to pay for the computer she had received.

The first issue is whether Marie can disaffirm the contract she made with Computer Store using the defense of minority. Under Restatement ยง 14, all contracts with minors are voidable because it is presumed that minors lack the capacity to act in their own best interest. This presumption is not rebuttable. However, if the minor is married, serving in the military, or living independently from parents or guardians following a judicial proceeding, the contract may be enforceable. Here, the defense of minority applies because Marie is 17 years old and there is no evidence that she is married or serves in the military. Marie lives with her mother, so she does not live independently even though her mother is in hospital. There is no evidence that Marie was legally emancipated following a court proceeding. Therefore, since Marie is a minor and no exceptions apply, she can disaffirm her contract with Computer Store.

The second issue is whether Marie will have to pay restitution to Computer Store when she disaffirms her contract for the purchase of a computer. Minors do not have to pay restitution where they disaffirm a contract unless the minor misrepresented information, there was tortious damage or willful destruction, or the contract applies to necessities. Here, the exceptions of misrepresentation do not apply because there is no evidence that Marie misrepresented facts when purchasing the computer, nor is there willful destruction because Marie did not cause damage to the computer, and the computer was not a necessity. Necessities are considered exceptions because adults should not be disincentivized from entering into contracts with minors. For example, if a minor needs to buy a car to go to school, a car vendor should not refuse to enter into a contract with the minor so as to sell them a car. Something that a parent or guardian could reasonably be able to provide would be disqualified from the necessity exception. Here, Marie had no parents or guardians who could reasonably buy her a computer. Computer Store will likely argue that the computer was a necessity for Marie to succeed in Zoom classes. Marie can argue that her old computer was not ideal but worked well enough for her to enroll and succeed in Zoom classes, wherefore purchasing a new computer from Computer Store was a luxury. Therefore, because Marie did not misrepresent facts nor willfully destroy the computer and because the computer Marie bought from Computer Store was not a necessity, Marie does not need to pay restitution.

In conclusion, Marie can void the contract she entered into with Computer Store because she is minor and no exceptions apply, and she will not have to pay restitution where she agreed to purchase and received a computer from Computer Store even though she failed to make monthly payments to pay for the computer she had received.
