Caption: Case Name, Page #, Parties, Court, Year

Purpose: What does this case teach me about the law?

Issue: Question that’s in front of the court. What’s the point of the dispute? Who is seeking relief and why? State as a question, start with the word “whether”, and make sure it is answerable in yes-or-no phrasing.

Parties’ Arguments:

-	 “The plaintiff is arguing …”
-	“The defendant is arguing…”

Procedural History: How did the case get to the court? Was there a decision in the lower courts? What was it? Look for keywords like “lower court”, “trial court”, “appellate”, etc.

Facts: Limit to legally-significant facts & necessary background facts. Facts should be straightforward and objective, not biased. Identify parties and describe relationship between them. What happened? When? You can also use timelines if helpful.

Rule of Law (from particular case you’re reading): What does this case add to the law? Narrow or broad? What becomes precedent?  What construction is at work: elements? Factors? A test?

Holding: Answers Issue. Test: Can you invert the issue statement you wrote and articulate the answer in a declarative sentence?

Judgment: What is this court doing to the case? Remanding (e.g., to ask lower court to find new legally relevant facts)? Vacating? Modifying? Again, look for keywords.

Reasoning: This should be the longest part of your case brief. How did the Court’s mind work? How did the court apply law to facts? Best to put it in your own words.

Dissent/Concurrence: The reasoning behind any opposing opinions, or opinions that reach the same holding as the majority, but offer different reasoning.

Comments – Individualize this! Anything that helps you connect this case to other cases you’re reading, anything you want to remember to ask about in class, etc.
