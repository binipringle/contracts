Working with Rules: Identifying Rule Structures

Locate the rule for foreseeability in Hadley.  What is the rule structure of that rule? Now read RST § 351.  Describe the similarities and differences between the two rules.  Identify the overall rule structure for foreseeability.
What is the difference between the two kinds of cases described in Hadley (“ordinary” and “special” circumstances cases)? Which kind of case is Hadley?
Theoretical Perspective:  Feminist Legal Theory

Consider what role, if any, you think gender played in Parker.
