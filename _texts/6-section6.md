The question is whether the court should admit extrinsic evidence of trade usage as part of the agreement between Fiber Industries (seller) and Salem Carpet (buyer) where Salem bought fiber from Fiber but refused to pay.

The first sub-issue is what term or clause is at issue. Terms in a contract can be express or implied. Express terms are terms that are written in the contract. Implied terms are terms not written in the contract but may be admissible by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance. A formalist interpretation of contracts does not admit implied terms but sticks to only terms within the four corners of the document. A contextualist approach looks outside the four corners of the document and allows implied terms. Here, the contract is silent as to the question of trade usage that the buyer is trying to introduce. Therefore, the term at issue is an implied term.

The next sub issue is whether the evidence amounts to trade usage, course of dealings, or course of performance. Under UCC, trade usage is defined as any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. Here, Salem was able to establish that there was a “customary practice” in the carpet industry obligating Fiber Industries to fill orders made by Salem during the projected market life of any carpet style that utilized fiber manufactured by Fiber Industries. Therefore, the evidence amounts to trade usage.

The next issue is whether this evidence of carpet industry trade usage is admissible under the Parol Evidence Rule. Under the Parol Evidence Rule, terms in writing may not be contradicted but may be supplemented or explained by trade usage, course of delivery or course of performance. However, consistent additional terms are not admissable if the contract is fully integrated. A contract is fully integrated where the document is the complete and final expression of the parties’ agreement. Courts determine whether a contract is fully integrated by looking at the intention of the parties through their words and actions, and whether there is a merger clause. 	Here, the evidence of carpet industry trade usage is trade usage that does not contradict the terms in writing because the contract is silent on the issue. The contract is fully integrated because it contains a merger clause which provides that the contract “contains all the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement and shall constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between Seller and Purchaser.” Therefore, the evidence of carpet industry trade usage is admissible because it is trade usage, supplements or explains the terms in writing, and is not an additional term.

Therefore, the court should admit extrinsic evidence of trade usage as part of the agreement between Fiber and Salem.
