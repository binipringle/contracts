What promises should the law enforce? (problem posted on TWEN)

Note: As a general rule, oral contracts are enforceable (except if they are fraud); there is no general common law rule requiring written evidence of a contract. (82)

Broad steps of analysis: Is there a contract? If contract, is it enforceable? What are the terms? Did a party breach? If there's a breach, what are the damages?

Why should the law enforce any promises?

1. Because of people's expectations; people expect that a contract will be enforced.
2. We want to protect contracting for business. Contract law doesn't penalize people for breaching contracts but it wants to compensate the party who suffered.

**Hypo:** I rent you an apartment. You agree to rent it for 2000. You decide to go to California so you breach. Apartment empty for a month. Then I rent it for 3000. Should you compensate me for my loss due to breach of contract? It depends.

Reasons to enforce a promise:

- Both agreed (assent)
- Exchange is important as opposed to gifts
- Reliance
- unjust enrichment (dog hypo)

Reasons not to enforce a promise:

- gift (no exchange)
- no real promise
- against public policy
- no assent

1. **From Kirksy v. Kirksy:** If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Henry would argue no because although he promised to let her “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.

**Summary:** The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract. This was a real question in this case. The court never got that far because this is a promise to give a gift. Why are promises to give gifts not binding? Because contract law says so. When I sell you my car it is an exchange. It's in the market. Here there was no exchange, so it wasn't a contract, said the court.

There's an alternative theory called reliancce theory. If he made a promise that she reasonably relied upon there might be a case.

2.	**Giant Steel** Should Giant Steel’s “promise” to stay open be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No. Giant Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable.

**Summary:**  You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.

3.	**"Surrogate" biological mother agreement to waive parental rights** After giving birth to a daughter, Margaret Gordon decides she cannot go ahead with the arrangement and refuses to give up the baby. Should the agreement be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No, because although Margaret Gordon promised to give up her parental rights, she had not yet given up these rights when she refused to hand over the baby, and parental rights probably supersede an agreement between private parties. However, Jack Higgins also has parental rights so they should get shared custody.

4. **Dog hypo:** Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals. Should the owner have to repay you for the out-of-pocket costs you incurred? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Yes, the owner should pay me the expenses I incurred in caring for the pet because the owner has an obligation to care for the pet. If the owner refuses to pay for the pet’s care the owner should give me the dog.  

**Notes from class:** When somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog is there an obligation to compensate? This is restitution theory.

Consideration Applications

Hamer v. Sidway (p. 193)

THIIS IIS AN OLD CASE THAT DOESN'T USE CCURRENT RULE - DON'T CITE IT - IT'S A CCASE THAT IILLUSTRRAATES DETRIMENT

uncle promises to give 15 yo nephew $5000 if nephew quits drinking, smoking etc. until he turns 21 (drinking and smoking were legal for young people at that time)
Nephew fully performs and asks for the money. uncle intends to pay but passes away before following through on his promise.

Is this bilateral or unilateral? Probably unilateral, but remember that the court favors bilateral.

Even if it looks unilateral it's not always a no-brainer. iif there's ever a questioin that iits uniilaterral, do a full irac

see recording! 6:46 professor provides rules and words for bilateral-unilateral irac.

What is the estate's argumennt that it doesn't have to pay this money? the estate argues that the uncle does not benefit from thhe contract, and the nephew does not suffer a detriment (nephew benefits). you could try to argue

what's the estate's argument that it doesn't have to pay?

What does the cocurt holdd? the nephew gave up a legal right. this is a legal detriiment.

legal ddetriment

don't need to show that the promise benefits the promisee orr harms the promisor
hust show pormisorr gave up a legal rightsabandons a right
limits his freedodm of actioin in the future

Legal Detriment

Don’t need to show that the promise benefits the promisee or harms the promisor.

Just show:  Promisor gave up a legal right

Forbearance/waiver of a legal right
Abandons a right
Limits his freedom of action in the future

1. give up a right
2. ... see reccocrding

legal detrriment - USE THIS DEFIINITION VERBATIM!!!!!

Both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

legal detrriment - USE THIS DEFIINITION VERBATIM!!!!!

EXPLANATION of above:

if i promise to do sth that I'm already obligated to do it doesn't make sense; i have to do it anyway. this is why ...promise to do sth i have a legal right NOT to do. parentheticals allow for a unilateral contract

i promise to pay you $100 if you paint my fence.

if analyze Hamerr, underr the benefits detriment test you have to show an actual benefit and ddettriment

under legal detriment you only have to show that a party gives up sth they have a legal right tto ddo.

The main thing in Hamer v. Segway is the rule for detriment. This is the current rule for detriment.

How would Hamer be deccided under Section 71?

- Legal detriment?
- Bargained for?

**Consideration**

1. There must be legal detriment (both parties)
2. It must be bargained for (both parties)

if the nephew would have quit smoking and drinking anyway, how would that affect the analysis? it would affect the motives. iif he's doing it because he thinks it's healthy and he would have done it anyway, his motive would not be to get the promise of $5000 -

the consideration is the whole thing: the get money from giving up ddrinking and smoking.

You have to move through the parrtiies.

first look at me. i either (1) promise to do something or (3) do something or (3) promise to refrain from ddoing something or (4) refrain from doing something.

**Consideration**

1. There must be legal detriment (both parties)
2. It must be bargained for (both parties)

part of the shift from benefit-detriment to the bargained for test is that tthe courtt won't inquire about the fairness of the terms because the courts presume that the parties are acting ratioinally; are accting in their own best interest; have full informatiion; when i pay 5000 for the care iit would be inefficcient for the court to intervene when i know my own assessment of the value of thhe car than the ccourt would. the court will not consider the adequacy of thhe cconsideration. the ccourt only cares that im giving up a legal right and youre giving up a legal right and my motive is to get your promise and your motive is to get my promise. thiis allows the court to escape the responsibiility to ensure the fairness of the terms.

Adequacy

- Courts will not inquire into adequacy of consideration (fairness).  Why?
- What assumptions does neo-classical economic theory make about motives and contracting?
- Why else might a consumer pay more than the market value for goods or services?

Price disparities can be based on:
- Lack of access to wider markets
- Traditional practice
- Discrimination/animus – race/class hostility
- No access to perfect information
- Systemic racism
- Structural discrimination

people do not always act in their own best interests. sometimes they can't.
sex
race
animus
things very structural prevent some people from having access to markets - contract law is based on assumptions that are not always true

Study by Ian Aris (Harvard) that shows that women historically and consistently pay more than men for cars and African Americans pay more than Whites and African American women pay more than African American men.

these disparities are very much bolstered by contract law because under the bargain theory the court does not look at fairness

Consideration is not the place to make these arguments. Defenses yes. Unconscionability

Neo-classical economic theory and Adequacy

Should sellers be permitted to charge what the market will bear, even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites?

What if individuals from those groups agree to pay more?

BF Hypo #1

I promise to paint you a painting for $500.  You agree.  My chief motive is fame – I don’t care about the money. Consideration?

not consideration because person says doesnt care about money

Bargained for

- Doesn’t have to be the only motive or even the predominant motive. Can be part bargain, part gift.
- Doesn’t even have to be the actual motive – use objective test (secret intentions don’t count)

BF Hypo #2

What if I already painted the painting and gave it to you.  Then you promised to give me $500?

is there a legal detriment? yes. i gave you painting which i had a legal right not to do andd you gave me the money whicch you had a legal right not to do.

is thhere a bargain? no. was i giving you thte painting so as to get money? no - although maybe i was hoping to get money -  are you promisiing to giive me the money so that i give you the painting? no. you already have thhe painting.

THIS IS PAST CONSIDERATION. But past consiidderation is a misnomer beccause there is really no consideration. the two thiings are nott connected legally under thhe consideratoin doctrine. I'm giving you the painting

Must be Bargained For:

- Each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- Given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- Legal Detriment

(it's a two-step analysis; 1st partty has tto be making their promise so as to get the return promise; 2nd party has to be making their prormise so as tto get the return promise)

Revisit Kirksey

Legal detriment? - if you ccome and see me i'll give you a placce to liive. is she doiing sthh she has a legal right not to ddo? yes. is he? yes.

Bargained for? is she movingg there so as to get a place to live? Is he giving her a placce to live so as to get her to move there? that's uncclear. when you look at his motives he's giviing her a place to live in order to get a preference on his land; so thtat was his motiive; he wanted to get her to move there so that she wouldd live there.

under these rules - cocnsideration - there was legaal detriment and iit was bargaiined for.

Bettty Jo Meter's ccase iis just an example of the bargained for theory failing

prof summarizes the Betty Jo case. basically an example of not being bargained for.

SBA v. Betty Jo Meadors (p 200)

Did the SBA ask Betty to sign the guaranty?
Was her guaranty necessary to close the loan transaction with the SBA?
Was there consideration for her promise? (which elements is at issue?)
Legal detriment?
Bargained for?

Langer

consideration

analyze legal detriment (irac) ... legal right to do, legal right not to do ...

analyze considerationn

something can be a gift and also be bargained for - it can be part bargained and part gift - but both parts are necessary.

"it was part gift and part bargain so there was cocnsideratiion"

bargained for vs. conditiion of gift

if i'm promising to give you the money when you alreaddy gave me tthe painting that's not a bargain; it's past consideration.

Hypo: i promiise to five you these two ttiicckets to the worrldd series if you cocme to my officce by tomorrow to picck them up.

There is a return promise so there's legal detriiment (i promise to give you the ticckets and ii have the legal right not to givem them to you andd you ccome to my officce and have a legal right not to go to my office) - i promise to give you tthe ticckts you promise to come to my officce to picck them up. So we have to look at motive.

kirksey iis sayiing i'm uprooting my family andd moving there iin exchange. now we have anotherr way of looking at itt. the moving there might justt be a cocnditioin of the gift. she cant get the gift without moving there. kirksey is giving sister in law a gift. a cocndition of the gift is her moving there. So kirksey it seems like a condditioin of a gift.

Langer does nott seem like a cocndiition of the gift because its not how youreceive the money, it's thhe actioins i'm seeking in order for ttis to make sense.

sometimes its hard to distinguish. the other factual distiinctiion is that langer is an employee-employer situatioinn and Kirksey is a family situation

the facct that kiirksey is a family situatioin ddoesnt mean thtat iit ccan't be bargained for, but a family siituatiion makes it more likely that its a gift.

Hypo number 1: answer: past consideration

question of motive -

b is giving a the book which she has a legal right not to do and a is giving money as a gift which a has a legal right not to do, so there is legal detriment. However, there is no connection in motive because the motive of the actiion is not to get the return promiise

Hypo number 2:
A promises to make a ggift... (see slide)
is there consideration between a and b? answer: no. it's a gift. there's no legal detriment. if i'm promisingg to give you a gift the legal detriment fails beccause you have no

Hypo number 3: is there consideration? answer: no.
legal detriment fails because i promise to giive you the car iis a lie, so here there iis no car; a is not promising to sell b a car; iit is a false cconsiderationn; easiier thing is tthat the som is promisiing the car to gett the money but the father is not promising to give the money so as to get the car knowiing that there iiis no car (in hypo it iis stated that A desires to make a binding promise to give $1000 to his son).  

Hypo number 4:

clearly nominal consideration

ccourt won't look at the adequacy of an exchange, but it will look at the motivation. Sufficiency.

- can't be nominal (e.g. $1)
- in name only

it's not that it's unfaiir, but it's that my motive was not to get tthe dollar i sold you the house for; i want to make you a gift; the $1 is in name only, it's fake. i am giiving you the house not in exchange for the money, but my motivation is not  

Hypo number 6:
where is the threshold? How about a promise to buy a $10 book for $100? How about a promise to buy a $10 book for $20? There is no thresholdd. you have to look at iit case by ccase, andd look at the parties anddd theiir relatioinships and their motivations. In the case of the father and the son and the $1 book for $1000, no reasonable person would believet that the father's motivatiion iiis that he wants the book.

Remember that part bargaiin part gift is a valid consieratoin

COPY FROM SLIDE!!! PROF SAYS THIS **HAS** TO BE IN OUTLINE

Bargained for

*can* be mixed motive
can't be past consideration
Can't be condition of a gift
can't be nominal  

(if in writing ii say sth is nominal i have to say the motive is not to get the return promise, it's a pretext for a gift )

Legal Detriment

can't be a gift
can't be pre-existing duty
can't be illusory

Hypo: Housing works. I buy a $10 book for $1000 because I want to support housing works but i also wantt the book. mixed motive.

Pre-exiisting duty

suppose ccity offers a reward to anyone who turns in a criminal
a police officer findds the criminal and turns him iin
can she collecct the reward?
- legal ddetriment? No. The ciity is paying the reward which it has a legal right not to ddo, but the police officer is turning in the criminal and she has a legal obliigation to turn in the ccriminal so she does not have a legal right nottt to turn in the criminal.
- Bargainedd for? The policce officcer might be partly motivated by getting in the rewardd andd partly by doing her job, but
- PRE-EXISTING

A promise to do somtehing one is already obligated to ddo is nnot validd. ccocnsideration. No legal detriment. they ddon't have a legal right not to do it. pre-exiisting duty ccan arise from law, contracct or ccustom.

Hypo

Contracctor agrees to construct a building ... SEE SLIDE!

Pre-existing duty arising from contract

This requirement of consideration prevents unfair  ...

Illusory promises (RST § 77)

I promise tto sell you my ccar unless I deccide not to
I promise to buy as manuy bushels of wheat from you that i want
I reserve tthe power to terminate the agreement at any time
i will if i want to

Performance is entirely optional
promise in form but not in substance

Illusory K hypo 1: SEE SLIDE
answer: I'm not promising anything

Illusory K hypo 2: I promise to buy from you all the coal that II'll need for the year if you promise to sell me all the ccoal that I order. Yes. Legal detriment

Rules of thumb

"want" is different from "need"
court will read a promise so that it's not illusory if possible (especially where there's an elaborate agreement)
court will impose an obligation of good faith: "I promise to buy this ..." SEE SLIDE

Hypo number 2

I promise to buy thiis business from you iif II decide... totally illusory

hypo nnumber 2 revised

im promising but also promising in good faith to use my best efforts to buy the property froom you

Rule of thumb for hypo 2:

if performance is entirely withiin one party's control, iit might be iillusory
BUT court will impose obligation of best efforts
"I promise ..." SEE SLIDE

Hypo number 3

I promise to spend as much ... see slide
probably not illusory. I promise to use good faith to do as much work as is necessary and it's up to me but I have to use good faith and best efforts.

Hypo number 4

I promise to purchase land for a shopping center if I can get leases for future occupanccy that are "satisfactory" to me.

I can't just turn every lease down. Because I promise *in good faith* to look for leases. I have to exerc

PUT THIS IN RULE:

when a party has discretiion, they must exerccise their judgment in good faaith.

words of promise - doesnt sound illusory - oh look at these words now iit looks illusory - look agaiin andd see if the cocurt can read iin the ... goodd faith .

Hypo number 5

terminate at any time without notice

it's illusoory, however:

Hypo number 5 modified

Not illusory because "...on one month's notice"
