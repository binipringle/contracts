What promises should the law enforce? (problem posted on TWEN)

Note: As a general rule, oral contracts are enforceable (except if they are fraud); there is no general common law rule requiring written evidence of a contract. (82)

1. **From Kirksy v. Kirksy** Anne is a widow raising several children. She and her children lived on a homesteading claim on public land. Anne received a letter from her brother-in-law that stated: “Dear sister Anne—I felt terrible upon learning of brother Henry’s death. I do not know if you have a preference on the place you are living on, but if you do, I would advise you to sell the land. If you come down to see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; on account of your situation, and that of your family, I feel I want you and the children to do well. Your brother-in-law, Henry.” Within a month or two of receiving this letter, Anne abandoned her homestead, moved into a house provided by Henry and began to farm his land. At first he put her and her family in a comfortable house and gave her land to cultivate, but at the end of two years, he notified her to move, and put her in a shack in the woods. He later asked her to move from that as well. If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Henry would argue no because although he promised to let her “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.

**Summary:** The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract. This was a real question in this case. The court never got that far because this is a promise to give a gift. Why are promises to give gifts not binding? Because contract law says so. When I sell you my car it is an exchange. It's in the market. Here there was no exchange, so it wasn't a contract, said the court.

There's an alternative theory called reliancce theory. If he made a promise that she reasonably relied upon there might be a case.

2.	**Giant Steel** Giant Steel, Inc. owns and operates two steel plants in Steeltown. Seventy percent of the residents of Steeltown works for one of these plants. The two plants have operated at a loss for some time. The public affairs officers and corporations managers issue internal memoranda which state: “The continued operation of these plants is absolutely dependent upon their being profit-makers. In the months ahead, we will be calling for the full support of each and every one of you. Your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate.” The workers give up Christmas bonuses, work overtime without pay, and do not make any efforts to explore relocation or transfer to other plants. Assume that Giant Steel decides to close the plants claiming “unprofitability.” Local 100 of the steelworkers union claims that the plants are profitable, and challenges the accounting procedures of management. Should Giant Steel’s “promise” to stay open be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No. Giant Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable.

**Summary:**  You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.

3.	**"Surrogate" biological mother agreement to waive parental rights** Jack Higgins (a biochemist) and his wife, Esther Higgins (a pediatrician), want to have children, but Esther Higgins would not consider becoming pregnant because she has multiple sclerosis. Even though there is no clear medical evidence that the pregnancy would harm her, she is afraid of possible health complications. For a fee of $7,500, a private agency introduced the Higginses to Margaret Gordon, a married woman who has two children, and arranged for them to enter into a surrogate parenting agreement. The agreement was set out in a written document. The Higginses agreed to pay Margaret Gordon $10,000 plus expenses if she has a live birth as a result of artificial insemination with Jack Higgins’s semen. Margaret Gordon agreed to the adoption of the child by Jack Higgins and to termination of her parental rights. After giving birth to a daughter, Margaret Gordon decides she cannot go ahead with the arrangement and refuses to give up the baby. Should the agreement be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No, because although Margaret Gordon promised to give up her parental rights, she had not yet given up these rights when she refused to hand over the baby, and parental rights probably supersede an agreement between private parties. However, Jack Higgins also has parental rights so they should get shared custody.

4. Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals. Should the owner have to repay you for the out-of-pocket costs you incurred? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Yes, the owner should pay me the expenses I incurred in caring for the pet because the owner has an obligation to care for the pet. If the owner refuses to pay for the pet’s care the owner should give me the dog.  

**Notes from class:** When somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog is there an obligation to compensate? This is restitution theory.

Notes from skills 2-1-21

where are we? bargain theory

what are the components? mutual assent and consideration

contract formation

End User License Agreements (EULAs)

1. Click wrap: applies to internet transactions. user must cclick on box saying "I agree." generally understood to manifest intent to enter into bargain.

2. browse wrap: like click wrap but you don't have to cliick "i agree." website provides noticce of terms and cocnidtions. you don't have to cclick but just by using the website you are agreeing to the terms of the agreement. websites not very uniform. have terms anddd ocnditions in different places. Browse wrap agreements are not uncommon. they arae generally accepted. there are terms and cocnditioins on most websites so ppl expect ppl to expect there are terms.

3. shrink wrap. applies to store bought software. or over the phone. reference to license agreements is placed on the outside of the packaging.

the rules of accceptance and the rules of objective assent aare bery complicaated. but the courts love them. the markets need them. there has to be an easy way for consumerrs to buy products. these are complicated but

Nguyen

who is the plaintiff? class action. Nguyen and all others similaarly situated -

barnes and nobles contract says you cannot bring a class action and any disputes will be resolved by arbitration

the contract said that cclaims shall not be consolidated. bn says it iis in coontract. nguyen says he didnt see this clause in the terms and cocndidtions.

arbbbitration: can be a good way of dispute resolution. can be a significant way to resolve disputes.

however, arbitrarion is a probblem. when you agree to not go to trial - when you agree to mandatory arbitration you are waiving your constitutional rights to a jury trial. youre agreeing to arbbitratioin . why bad? beccause studies have shown that arbitration heavily favors corporations over individuals and employers over employees.

mandatory arbitration is a huge thing in contracct laaw. repeat perrformance: the ocmpany is going to keep going bacck to arbitration, and the arbitrator is chosen by the parrties so they have every reason to please theiir hcoosers

arbitration has fewerr restricctions and rules - it results in the consumer losing; generally, arbitrration claims cannot be brought as class actions.

when youre buying sth online youre not going to negotiate terms. when youre getting hiired youre not going to want to ddispleaase.

why does nguyen think he is not bound by the arbitratioin clause? he arrgues that beccause he never signed anything. hhe says he never cliccked i agree and never even saw the contracct. he hhad not notice of the terrms.

bn argued that the contract is posted on their webbsite. Nguyen had construcctive notice of the contracct. this is like when you click or not. it doesnt matter because if person wants to know terms they are findable.  

the court says - they use basic offer and acceptance terms - you need a mutual manifestation of intent. The court finds that if you cliick aroundd on the website that indiiicates assesnt.

validity of browse wrap is ...

RULE

user must have actual or constructive knowledge of the websites terms and conditions... see slide SLIDE IS Rule

This ccase - you can see the court's disfavor of browse wrap contraccts. ocurt is requiering very specifeicc placements of information.

what does it matter if term is conspicuous or not? after case bn changes terms of use. however, practically this is not what s going to make a difference.

HYPO - shrink ware




ccome up with gateways argument. what is gateways argument that this was part of the


Consumer orders computer software from Gateway
Software arrives including list of terms
Says these terms will apply if the customer uses the software or fails to return it after 30 days.
Customer keeps the software for more than 30 days
Later has a complaint about the software
One term says mandatory arbitration
He wants to sue in court

Issue:  Are these additional terms part of the contract? (is he limited to arbitration?)

Who made the offer?  Who accepted?  At what moment?
Include policy arguments

customer says ii diddnt agree to arbitration. i didnt agree to them because i didnt have accccess to those terms when i bought the softwarer. using traditoinal offer and accepatance analyssis the customerr would say terms occuredd when customer bought software from gagteway over the phone. that was the contract.  

Did a party make an offer?
Was there acceptance?
“Manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain on the terms proposed by the offeror.”
Mutuality: No contract is formed unless both parties manifest the willingness to enter into a bargain.

Gateway made an offer when they said what they were selling, the customer said they'd purchase it, and Gateway said they'dd send it. Customer calls in and gateway makes the offer. they say ok well sell you the software. we promiise to sell it to you for x amount of money - mode of acceptance is exclusive - basically by using the goods - exerccisiing dominion over the goods - or by siilence - over 30 days. The way courts interrpret this is as you guys said. the only way to acccept is to use the software or to be silent for 30 days,

the way these shrink wrap agreements work is there is a conspicouus notice on the outside of the software that says that the terms are inside the package.

One other thing: policy: gateway would argue that in erms of policy this is reasonable because if these 30 days did not constitute acceptance we would be in a perpetual state of uncertainty as to whether the products were sold; this is what is necessary for markets to function. why not on the phone? nobody is going to wait on the phone while gateway reads the contract.

what iis in these thirty days ocntracts? waaivers of warranty, limitation of liability, mandatory arbiitration;

these type of shrink wrap contracts might not be enforceable iif our societies decided that tthey were not wanted. Courts make an argument withh thhirty day accceptance based on poliicy.

consideration

contracts should be enforced when the parties agree to exchange one thing for another
based on notions of fairness, reliance, and efficiency - policy is informed by neo-classical economic theory "when there is an exchange we assume that the parties are acting freely and reaasonably" this is capitalism. free market economy.
doctrine of consideration is reason for enforcing promises

Courts don't look at value of exchange. But they do look at motivation of exchange.

remember fundamental principle that courts don't like to intervene in the fairness of the deal. Neo-classical economic theory. Courts assume that both parties are acting rationally and agree on the price.

There has to be an exchange vs. a gift. Question is, is it a gift or consideration?  

In 16th century contracts were enforced when the court could find any motive for entering into a contract. Had reasons. Every time there was an understandable motive for entering into the contract, the contract should be enforced.

Late 1800s and early 1900s consideration doctrrine really shifted to look for tthte inducement. ccocurts werre looking at the benefits andd detriments of the contract for the partiies. Benefit-detriment test. Both parties have to receive a benefit and incur a detriment.

Now it has shifted baack to motiive. but very speciifiicc motive. i sell you a car for money. my motive has to be getting the return promise - to get the money. your motive has to be getting the car. now ccourts are looking at whether my motive is to be getting the car.

Consideration § 71

Must be Bargained For:

- Each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- Given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- Legal Detriment

(it's a two-step analysis; 1st partty has tto be making their promise so as to get the return promise; 2nd party has to be making their prormise so as tto get the return promise)

Both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

both parties must be makiing their promise so as to get tthe return promise.

in the family setting, very often the motive of a promise is gratuitous; not to get the return promise.

let's suppose i promise to give you $5000 if you promiise to make a present to xyd charittable foundatiion.

Consideration Applications

Hamer v. Sidway (p. 193)

THIIS IIS AN OLD CASE THAT DOESN'T USE CCURRENT RULE - DON'T CITE IT - IT'S A CCASE THAT IILLUSTRRAATES DETRIMENT

uncle promises to give 15 yo nephew $5000 if nephew quits drinking, smoking etc. until he turns 21 (drinking and smoking were legal for young people at that time)
Nephew fully performs and asks for the money. uncle intends to pay but passes away before following through on his promise.

Is this bilateral or unilateral? Probably unilateral, but remember that the court favors bilateral.

Even if it looks unilateral it's not always a no-brainer. iif there's ever a questioin that iits uniilaterral, do a full irac

see recording! 6:46 professor provides rules and words for bilateral-unilateral irac.

What is the estate's argumennt that it doesn't have to pay this money? the estate argues that the uncle does not benefit from thhe contract, and the nephew does not suffer a detriment (nephew benefits). you could try to argue

what's the estate's argument that it doesn't have to pay?

What does the cocurt holdd? the nephew gave up a legal right. this is a legal detriiment.

legal ddetriment

don't need to show that the promise benefits the promisee orr harms the promisor
hust show pormisorr gave up a legal rightsabandons a right
limits his freedodm of actioin in the future

Legal Detriment

Don’t need to show that the promise benefits the promisee or harms the promisor.

Just show:  Promisor gave up a legal right

Forbearance/waiver of a legal right
Abandons a right
Limits his freedom of action in the future

1. give up a right
2. ... see reccocrding

legal detrriment - USE THIS DEFIINITION VERBATIM!!!!!

Both parties must promise to do something (or do something) they have a legal right not to do, or promise to refrain from doing something (or refrain from doing something) they have a legal right to do.

legal detrriment - USE THIS DEFIINITION VERBATIM!!!!!

EXPLANATION of above:

if i promise to do sth that I'm already obligated to do it doesn't make sense; i have to do it anyway. this is why ...promise to do sth i have a legal right NOT to do. parentheticals allow for a unilateral contract

i promise to pay you $100 if you paint my fence.

if analyze Hamerr, underr the benefits detriment test you have to show an actual benefit and ddettriment

under legal detriment you only have to show that a party gives up sth they have a legal right tto ddo.

The main thing in Hamer v. Segway is the rule for detriment. This is the current rule for detriment.

How would Hamer be deccided under Section 71?

- Legal detriment?
- Bargained for?

**Consideration**

1. There must be legal detriment (both parties)
2. It must be bargained for (both parties)

if the nephew would have quit smoking and drinking anyway, how would that affect the analysis? it would affect the motives. iif he's doing it because he thinks it's healthy and he would have done it anyway, his motive would not be to get the promise of $5000 -

the consideration is the whole thing: the get money from giving up ddrinking and smoking.

You have to move through the parrtiies.

first look at me. i either (1) promise to do something or (3) do something or (3) promise to refrain from ddoing something or (4) refrain from doing something.

**Consideration**

1. There must be legal detriment (both parties)
2. It must be bargained for (both parties)

part of the shift from benefit-detriment to the bargained for test is that tthe courtt won't inquire about the fairness of the terms because the courts presume that the parties are acting ratioinally; are accting in their own best interest; have full informatiion; when i pay 5000 for the care iit would be inefficcient for the court to intervene when i know my own assessment of the value of thhe car than the ccourt would. the court will not consider the adequacy of thhe cconsideration. the ccourt only cares that im giving up a legal right and youre giving up a legal right and my motive is to get your promise and your motive is to get my promise. thiis allows the court to escape the responsibiility to ensure the fairness of the terms.

Adequacy

- Courts will not inquire into adequacy of consideration (fairness).  Why?
- What assumptions does neo-classical economic theory make about motives and contracting?
- Why else might a consumer pay more than the market value for goods or services?

Price disparities can be based on:
- Lack of access to wider markets
- Traditional practice
- Discrimination/animus – race/class hostility
- No access to perfect information
- Systemic racism
- Structural discrimination

people do not always act in their own best interests. sometimes they can't.
sex
race
animus
things very structural prevent some people from having access to markets - contract law is based on assumptions that are not always true

Study by Ian Aris (Harvard) that shows that women historically and consistently pay more than men for cars and African Americans pay more than Whites and African American women pay more than African American men.

these disparities are very much bolstered by contract law because under the bargain theory the court does not look at fairness

Consideration is not the place to make these arguments. Defenses yes. Unconscionability

Neo-classical economic theory and Adequacy

Should sellers be permitted to charge what the market will bear, even if it means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods, charging women more than men, or charging BIPOC more than Whites?

What if individuals from those groups agree to pay more?

BF Hypo #1

I promise to paint you a painting for $500.  You agree.  My chief motive is fame – I don’t care about the money. Consideration?

not consideration because person says doesnt care about money

Bargained for

- Doesn’t have to be the only motive or even the predominant motive. Can be part bargain, part gift.
- Doesn’t even have to be the actual motive – use objective test (secret intentions don’t count)

BF Hypo #2

What if I already painted the painting and gave it to you.  Then you promised to give me $500?

is there a legal detriment? yes. i gave you painting which i had a legal right not to do andd you gave me the money whicch you had a legal right not to do.

is thhere a bargain? no. was i giving you thte painting so as to get money? no - although maybe i was hoping to get money -  are you promisiing to giive me the money so that i give you the painting? no. you already have thhe painting.

THIS IS PAST CONSIDERATION. But past consiidderation is a misnomer beccause there is really no consideration. the two thiings are nott connected legally under thhe consideratoin doctrine. I'm giving you the painting

Must be Bargained For:

- Each promise has to be sought by the promisor in exchange for her promise; and
- Given by the promisee in exchange for that promise
- Legal Detriment

(it's a two-step analysis; 1st partty has tto be making their promise so as to get the return promise; 2nd party has to be making their prormise so as tto get the return promise)

Revisit Kirksey

Legal detriment? - if you ccome and see me i'll give you a placce to liive. is she doiing sthh she has a legal right not to ddo? yes. is he? yes.

Bargained for? is she movingg there so as to get a place to live? Is he giving her a placce to live so as to get her to move there? that's uncclear. when you look at his motives he's giviing her a place to live in order to get a preference on his land; so thtat was his motiive; he wanted to get her to move there so that she wouldd live there.

under these rules - cocnsideration - there was legaal detriment and iit was bargaiined for.

Bettty Jo Meter's ccase iis just an example of the bargained for theory failing

prof summarizes the Betty Jo case. basically an example of not being bargained for.

SBA v. Betty Jo Meadors (p 200)

Did the SBA ask Betty to sign the guaranty?
Was her guaranty necessary to close the loan transaction with the SBA?
Was there consideration for her promise? (which elements is at issue?)
Legal detriment?
Bargained for?
