What promises should the law enforce? (problem posted on TWEN)

Note: As a general rule, oral contracts are enforceable (except if they are fraud); there is no general common law rule requiring written evidence of a contract. (82)

1. **From Kirksy v. Kirksy** Anne is a widow raising several children. She and her children lived on a homesteading claim on public land. Anne received a letter from her brother-in-law that stated: “Dear sister Anne—I felt terrible upon learning of brother Henry’s death. I do not know if you have a preference on the place you are living on, but if you do, I would advise you to sell the land. If you come down to see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; on account of your situation, and that of your family, I feel I want you and the children to do well. Your brother-in-law, Henry.” Within a month or two of receiving this letter, Anne abandoned her homestead, moved into a house provided by Henry and began to farm his land. At first he put her and her family in a comfortable house and gave her land to cultivate, but at the end of two years, he notified her to move, and put her in a shack in the woods. He later asked her to move from that as well. If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Henry would argue no because although he promised to let her “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.

**Summary:** The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract. This was a real question in this case. The court never got that far because this is a promise to give a gift. Why are promises to give gifts not binding? Because contract law says so. When I sell you my car it is an exchange. It's in the market. Here there was no exchange, so it wasn't a contract, said the court.

There's an alternative theory called reliancce theory. If he made a promise that she reasonably relied upon there might be a case.

2.	**Giant Steel** Giant Steel, Inc. owns and operates two steel plants in Steeltown. Seventy percent of the residents of Steeltown works for one of these plants. The two plants have operated at a loss for some time. The public affairs officers and corporations managers issue internal memoranda which state: “The continued operation of these plants is absolutely dependent upon their being profit-makers. In the months ahead, we will be calling for the full support of each and every one of you. Your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate.” The workers give up Christmas bonuses, work overtime without pay, and do not make any efforts to explore relocation or transfer to other plants. Assume that Giant Steel decides to close the plants claiming “unprofitability.” Local 100 of the steelworkers union claims that the plants are profitable, and challenges the accounting procedures of management. Should Giant Steel’s “promise” to stay open be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No. Giant Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable.

**Summary:**  You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.

3.	**"Surrogate" biological mother agreement to waive parental rights** Jack Higgins (a biochemist) and his wife, Esther Higgins (a pediatrician), want to have children, but Esther Higgins would not consider becoming pregnant because she has multiple sclerosis. Even though there is no clear medical evidence that the pregnancy would harm her, she is afraid of possible health complications. For a fee of $7,500, a private agency introduced the Higginses to Margaret Gordon, a married woman who has two children, and arranged for them to enter into a surrogate parenting agreement. The agreement was set out in a written document. The Higginses agreed to pay Margaret Gordon $10,000 plus expenses if she has a live birth as a result of artificial insemination with Jack Higgins’s semen. Margaret Gordon agreed to the adoption of the child by Jack Higgins and to termination of her parental rights. After giving birth to a daughter, Margaret Gordon decides she cannot go ahead with the arrangement and refuses to give up the baby. Should the agreement be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No, because although Margaret Gordon promised to give up her parental rights, she had not yet given up these rights when she refused to hand over the baby, and parental rights probably supersede an agreement between private parties. However, Jack Higgins also has parental rights so they should get shared custody.

4. Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals. Should the owner have to repay you for the out-of-pocket costs you incurred? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Yes, the owner should pay me the expenses I incurred in caring for the pet because the owner has an obligation to care for the pet. If the owner refuses to pay for the pet’s care the owner should give me the dog.  

**Notes from class:** When somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog is there an obligation to compensate? This is restitution theory.

Notes from skills 2-1-21

where are we? bargain theory

what are the components? mutual assent and consideration

contract formation

End User License Agreements (EULAs)

1. Click wrap: applies to internet transactions. user must cclick on box saying "I agree." generally understood to manifest intent to enter into bargain.

2. browse wrap: like click wrap but you don't have to cliick "i agree." website provides noticce of terms and cocnidtions. you don't have to cclick but just by using the website you are agreeing to the terms of the agreement. websites not very uniform. have terms anddd ocnditions in different places. Browse wrap agreements are not uncommon. they arae generally accepted. there are terms and cocnditioins on most websites so ppl expect ppl to expect there are terms.

3. shrink wrap. applies to store bought software. or over the phone. reference to license agreements is placed on the outside of the packaging.

the rules of accceptance and the rules of objective assent aare bery complicaated. but the courts love them. the markets need them. there has to be an easy way for consumerrs to buy products. these are complicated but

Nguyen

who is the plaintiff? class action. Nguyen and all others similaarly situated -

barnes and nobles contract says you cannot bring a class action and any disputes will be resolved by arbitration

the contract said that cclaims shall not be consolidated. bn says it iis in coontract. nguyen says he didnt see this clause in the terms and cocndidtions.

arbbbitration: can be a good way of dispute resolution. can be a significant way to resolve disputes.

however, arbitrarion is a probblem. when you agree to not go to trial - when you agree to mandatory arbitration you are waiving your constitutional rights to a jury trial. youre agreeing to arbbitratioin . why bad? beccause studies have shown that arbitration heavily favors corporations over individuals and employers over employees.

mandatory arbitration is a huge thing in contracct laaw. repeat perrformance: the ocmpany is going to keep going bacck to arbitration, and the arbitrator is chosen by the parrties so they have every reason to please theiir hcoosers

arbitration has fewerr restricctions and rules - it results in the consumer losing; generally, arbitrration claims cannot be brought as class actions.

when youre buying sth online youre not going to negotiate terms. when youre getting hiired youre not going to want to ddispleaase.

why does nguyen think he is not bound by the arbitratioin clause? he arrgues that beccause he never signed anything. hhe says he never cliccked i agree and never even saw the contracct. he hhad not notice of the terrms.

bn argued that the contract is posted on their webbsite. Nguyen had construcctive notice of the contracct. this is like when you click or not. it doesnt matter because if person wants to know terms they are findable.  

the court says - they use basic offer and acceptance terms - you need a mutual manifestation of intent. The court finds that if you cliick aroundd on the website that indiiicates assesnt.

validity of browse wrap is ...

RULE

user must have actual or constructive knowledge of the websites terms and conditions... see slide SLIDE IS Rule

This ccase - you can see the court's disfavor of browse wrap contraccts. ocurt is requiering very specifeicc placements of information.

what does it matter if term is conspicuous or not? after case bn changes terms of use. however, practically this is not what s going to make a difference.

HYPO - shrink ware




ccome up with gateways argument. what is gateways argument that this was part of the


Consumer orders computer software from Gateway
Software arrives including list of terms
Says these terms will apply if the customer uses the software or fails to return it after 30 days.
Customer keeps the software for more than 30 days
Later has a complaint about the software
One term says mandatory arbitration
He wants to sue in court

Issue:  Are these additional terms part of the contract? (is he limited to arbitration?)

Who made the offer?  Who accepted?  At what moment?
Include policy arguments

customer says ii diddnt agree to arbitration. i didnt agree to them because i didnt have accccess to those terms when i bought the softwarer. using traditoinal offer and accepatance analyssis the customerr would say terms occuredd when customer bought software from gagteway over the phone. that was the contract.  

Did a party make an offer?
Was there acceptance?
“Manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain on the terms proposed by the offeror.”
Mutuality: No contract is formed unless both parties manifest the willingness to enter into a bargain.

Gateway made an offer when they said what they were selling, the customer said they'd purchase it, and Gateway said they'dd send it. Customer calls in and gateway makes the offer. they say ok well sell you the software. we promiise to sell it to you for x amount of money - mode of acceptance is exclusive - basically by using the goods - exerccisiing dominion over the goods - or by siilence - over 30 days. The way courts interrpret this is as you guys said. the only way to acccept is to use the software or to be silent for 30 days,

the way these shrink wrap agreements work is there is a conspicouus notice on the outside of the software that says that the terms are inside the package.

One other thing: policy: gateway would argue that in erms of policy this is reasonable because if these 30 days did not constitute acceptance we would be in a perpetual state of uncertainty as to whether the products were sold; this is what is necessary for markets to function. why not on the phone? nobody is going to wait on the phone while gateway reads the contract.

what iis in these thirty days ocntracts? waaivers of warranty, limitation of liability, mandatory arbiitration;

these type of shrink wrap contracts might not be enforceable iif our societies decided that tthey were not wanted. Courts make an argument withh thhirty day accceptance based on poliicy.
