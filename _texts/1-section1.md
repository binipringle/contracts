What promises should the law enforce? (problem posted on TWEN)

1. **From Kirksy v. Kirksy** Anne is a widow raising several children. She and her children lived on a homesteading claim on public land. Anne received a letter from her brother-in-law that stated: “Dear sister Anne—I felt terrible upon learning of brother Henry’s death. I do not know if you have a preference on the place you are living on, but if you do, I would advise you to sell the land. If you come down to see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; on account of your situation, and that of your family, I feel I want you and the children to do well. Your brother-in-law, Henry.” Within a month or two of receiving this letter, Anne abandoned her homestead, moved into a house provided by Henry and began to farm his land. At first he put her and her family in a comfortable house and gave her land to cultivate, but at the end of two years, he notified her to move, and put her in a shack in the woods. He later asked her to move from that as well. If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Henry would argue no because although he promised to let her “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.

**Summary:** The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract. This was a real question in this case. The court never got that far because this is a promise to give a gift. Why are promises to give gifts not binding? Because contract law says so. When I sell you my car it is an exchange. It's in the market. Here there was no exchange, so it wasn't a contract, said the court.

There's an alternative theory called reliancce theory. If he made a promise that she reasonably relied upon there might be a case.

2.	**Giant Steel** Giant Steel, Inc. owns and operates two steel plants in Steeltown. Seventy percent of the residents of Steeltown works for one of these plants. The two plants have operated at a loss for some time. The public affairs officers and corporations managers issue internal memoranda which state: “The continued operation of these plants is absolutely dependent upon their being profit-makers. In the months ahead, we will be calling for the full support of each and every one of you. Your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate.” The workers give up Christmas bonuses, work overtime without pay, and do not make any efforts to explore relocation or transfer to other plants. Assume that Giant Steel decides to close the plants claiming “unprofitability.” Local 100 of the steelworkers union claims that the plants are profitable, and challenges the accounting procedures of management. Should Giant Steel’s “promise” to stay open be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No. Giant Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable.

**Summary:**  You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.

3.	**"Surrogate" biological mother agreement to waive parental rights** Jack Higgins (a biochemist) and his wife, Esther Higgins (a pediatrician), want to have children, but Esther Higgins would not consider becoming pregnant because she has multiple sclerosis. Even though there is no clear medical evidence that the pregnancy would harm her, she is afraid of possible health complications. For a fee of $7,500, a private agency introduced the Higginses to Margaret Gordon, a married woman who has two children, and arranged for them to enter into a surrogate parenting agreement. The agreement was set out in a written document. The Higginses agreed to pay Margaret Gordon $10,000 plus expenses if she has a live birth as a result of artificial insemination with Jack Higgins’s semen. Margaret Gordon agreed to the adoption of the child by Jack Higgins and to termination of her parental rights. After giving birth to a daughter, Margaret Gordon decides she cannot go ahead with the arrangement and refuses to give up the baby. Should the agreement be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No, because although Margaret Gordon promised to give up her parental rights, she had not yet given up these rights when she refused to hand over the baby, and parental rights probably supersede an agreement between private parties. However, Jack Higgins also has parental rights so they should get shared custody.

4. Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals. Should the owner have to repay you for the out-of-pocket costs you incurred? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Yes, the owner should pay me the expenses I incurred in caring for the pet because the owner has an obligation to care for the pet. If the owner refuses to pay for the pet’s care the owner should give me the dog.  

**Notes from class:** When somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog is there an obligation to compensate? This is restitution theory.

Notes 1-27: pasted text from slides:

Offer: § 24: Manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain made by offeror to offeree

Acceptance: Manifestation of intent to enter into a bargain on the terms proposed by the offeror.

Hypos:

Will you sell me your property for $60,000?


It would not be possible for me to sell it unless I would receive $70,000 cash.


Do you want to buy 240 good 1000 lb cattle for $1000?

Offer Factors: these are some of the factors we would use to see if there was an offer in the rancher test. It's similar to the factors in the objective test. This list is a bit particular to offers.

Language – words of promise or commitment? For there to be an offer there doesn't have to be words of promise; but if there are that makes it more likely that there is an offer.
Level of detail: in Rancher hypo not much detail in first convo, but in letter a lot more, and the more detail the more like an offer.
Number of people to whom addressed (and does it name a party or parties?): in Rancher four people; that's not infinite, very finite, but still more thhan hhe could accommodate. Also did Rancher name people? Yes, neighbors, so more liikeley offer
Trade usage / custom:  
Prior dealings / prior conversations: for example we have been dealing with each other and month to month contract but every month we renew so we understand there's an expectation to renew
Characterization (price quotation, ad…): if its an ad, it's usually not an offer; if it's a reward, it usually is an offer.

Additional Factors Consideredin Pepsico:

- Price: the court says that the price is very low because -the jet is worth about 23 million dollars. If the price is extremely disproportionate to the actual value, the less likely it is to be an offer.
- Ability to follow through: fighter jet not for regular consumption; Pepsico not likely to be able to follow through with delivering a Harrier jet to a sixteen-year old.
- Level of seriousness: a reasonable person would understand that it's a joke.
- Characterization of the proposal: What does the court say about Ads?

**Advertisements**

General Rule: An ad is not an offer
Presumption:  Solicitation of offer / invitation to negotiate. Even if it has all the detail in it, it's still presumed to be a solicitation of an offer ratherr than an offer, *because it goes to a lot of people* - it doesn't matter how detailed iit is. It's not an offer unless it fits into one of the exceptions.

**Exceptions**

1. Limits number of people who can accept, e.g., "first come first served"; "while supplies last"
2. Invites performance, e.g. offer for a reward, prove me wrong, or prizes for skill and luck (I've only got one cat so I've limited the number of people, and I've induced performance); they're not worried about the number of people who will
3. Communicates willingness to commit

Carbolic Smoke Ball (p 101)

100 pounds to anyone who uses the product and still gets the flu.

Why was the ad in Carbolic Smoke Ball an offer?

*Usually* considered offers:  

Offer of Rewards -
Prove me wrong offers
Prizes for skill and luck

Limits the number of people who can accept
Induces action

Advertisements
price quotes, catalogues, price lists
putting price tag on an item and placing it on a shelf in a store

(But rebuttable presumptions)

Usually not considered an offer:

Pepsico: Arguments that it’s not an offer?

Argument that not an offer:

It was just an advertisement
This was an ad on TV; TV ads are exactly the kind of ad that are generally not considered an offer.

Any counterargument?

You can make the case that it seeks to induce performance, and that performance is to collect Pepsico points. On the one hand you could say that it's inducing performance, because you keep buying Pepsis. The court did not agree, and said that pepsi was not inducing promise, but inducing a counter promise.

If just an ad, what about the rest of the items in the commercial (leather jacket, sun glasses, etc.)?

If it's just an ad, and there are no exceptions, there's no issue with the leather jacket or the sunglasses; this is not an offer.

Arguments NOT an offer

Characterization:  Not that definite
Trade usage: not in the catalog
Level of seriousness: just a joke   
Price:  Too good to be true

Arguments it WAS an offer

Same level of commitment / definiteness as other items in the commercial
Price: maybe reasonable person not aware of price discrepancy or that it is a fighter jet  
Trade usage:

Apply socially situated RP test - court says ad is targeting younger generation - the pepsi generation - you might say that a reasonable teenager doesn't know that it is a fighter jet.
