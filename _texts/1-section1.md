# I. Always

1. Read the call of the question and set up broad structure
2. Read the hypo slowly, sentence by sentence
3. Mark issues as you encounter them
4. Broadly outline your answer, using IRAC
- (1) Start by writing an issue statement for each broad issue
- (2) Then, write the corresponding broad rule/policy
5. Make your outline more precise
- (1) Write issue statements for each narrow issue (mini-IRACs)
- (2) Then, add the corresponding narrow rules (in each mini-IRAC)
6. Write your answer
- (1) Analyze each side's argument in each mini-IRAC
- (2) Conclude for each mini-IRAC
7. Conclude for each large issue
8. You're done!

# II. In More Detail

*from skills 2-16-21*

## STEP ONE

Does the transaction involve a contract for the sale of movable goods? Identify:

1. Movable goods (not land, buildings, any other real property, rights)
2. Buyer
3. Seller
4. Sale: transfer for a price (not renting)

**If no, not movable goods: common law**

**If yes, movable goods: UCC**

## STEP TWO

<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;"><b>1. UCC or Common Law (small IRAC)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;"><b>2. Formation (three IRACs)</b> Was there a contact formed (bargain theory via common law or UCC rules?)?</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>I. Offer?</b> (If no offer say, “assuming that the court finds acceptance to be satisfied, we move onto acceptance”)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Termination</b> (can go here or in acceptance) (small IRAC)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">Rule: Ways to terminate an offer</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Only offeree can reject</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Terminated forever</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Revocation</b> (small IRAC)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">Rule:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Offeree must have ACTUAL notice of revocation</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Actual notice does not have to come from offeror</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;"><i>Dickinson v. Dodds</i> case illustration</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Any time prior to acceptance UNLESS</p>
<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-right:10%;">To revoke ads in newspaper or to general public the revocation must be communicated in the same form the ad was</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Lapse</b> (small IRAC)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">Rule:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Offeror can specify lapse time (e.g., open until March 1st)</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">If there is no specified time, then lapses in reasonable time. What reasonable time is construed as being differs depending on the offer</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Offer made in face to face convo lapses when convo over</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Writing - objective test; with factors - industry standards, language, size of the subject of the contract (if house big deal so stays on table longer; if event happening soon, deal stays on table shorter time)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Death or incapacity of either party</b> (small IRAC? capacity IRAC?)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">Rule:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">An offer/contract is not transferable</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Exceptions</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Option contract - common law (if not movable goods): Requires 2 elements: additional consideration of any value to courts AND signed writing.</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">Firm offer (UCC): Only requires a signed writing; no additional consideration needed. Becomes irrevocable for either a specified time or a reasonable time not to exceed 3 months (UCC defines 3 months as commercially reasonable time to keep contract open.</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Reasonable reliance</b> (Drennan case) - if the offerer reasonably knew or could infer that the offeror would reasonably rely on the offer, it becomes binding.</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Part performance of unilateral contract.</b> Any time you start performing on a unilateral contract makes it irrevocable by the offeror (Bodacious Brownie Sundae hypo [slide/video from 2 13 21 skills]). Difference between mere preparation and beginning performance; rule for drawing line is (remember Home Depot) - you just have to start performance; you don’t have to substantially perform. If you buy paint at home depot and drive to job, this is mere preparation. If paint two slats, this is beginning performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;"><b>II. Acceptance</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;">(Or counteroffer?) UCC rules? (If UCC no mirror image rule in acceptance)</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%; margin-right:10%;"><b>If YES</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:50%; margin-right:10%;">1. Issues with TERMS?</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%; margin-right:10%;">2. Breach</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%; margin-right:10%;">3. DEFENSES to Formation?</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%; margin-right:10%;">4. Damages</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:10%;"><b>If NO</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:10%;">Alternative theories?</p>
<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:10%;">Reliance</p>
<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:10%;">Restitution</p>

---

<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;"><b>III. Consideration</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>If no contract,</b> lay out all the rules saying what could have happened that would have made it a contract. Do this in IRACs structured in the same way. Then IRAC alternative remedies (the one[s] that could be applied)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Alternative remedies</b> (can go here or in acceptance) (small IRAC)</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">Rule: general rule alternative remedies</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Promissory estoppel</b> IRAC</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Promise for a past benefit</b> IRAC</p>
<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;"><b>Restitution</b> IRAC</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:10%;"><b>If yes consideration, IRAC consideration.</b></p>

If we can say yes, yes, yes to the three elements of contract formation, we go to statute of frauds. The statute of frauds is a sort of threshold for the bargain theory. We have to go through it to make a contract enforceable.

Does the statute of frauds apply? Is the statute of frauds satisfied?

**If the statute of frauds is not satisfied, we go back to promissory estoppel or restitution.**

**If the statute of frauds is satisfied, we go to a bunch of other rules.**

## Reliance IRAC

I: Whether reliance theory will be a good basis for recovery

R: Elements (4); policy; strict v. flexible approach.

A: [strict v. flexible analysis; then mini-IRACs]

i: The first sub-issue is whether there was a promise [objective test]

r: Under the objective theory, courts examine...

a: Here ... because ... [any counterargument?]

c: Therefore, ...

i: The second sub-issue is whether there was reliance on the promise [change of position]

r: To satisfy this element there has to be a change of position, and there has to be a causal connection between the change of position and the promise and

a: Here, ... because ...

c: Therefore, ...

i: The third sub-issue is whether the reliance was reasonable [context/factors]

rac

i: The fourth sub-issue is whether the reliance caused harm [beyond not getting the thing promised]

rac

C: Conclusion.
