# What promises should the law enforce? (problem posted on TWEN)

1. **From Kirksy v. Kirksy** Anne is a widow raising several children. She and her children lived on a homesteading claim on public land. Anne received a letter from her brother-in-law that stated: “Dear sister Anne—I felt terrible upon learning of brother Henry’s death. I do not know if you have a preference on the place you are living on, but if you do, I would advise you to sell the land. If you come down to see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land than I can tend; on account of your situation, and that of your family, I feel I want you and the children to do well. Your brother-in-law, Henry.” Within a month or two of receiving this letter, Anne abandoned her homestead, moved into a house provided by Henry and began to farm his land. At first he put her and her family in a comfortable house and gave her land to cultivate, but at the end of two years, he notified her to move, and put her in a shack in the woods. He later asked her to move from that as well. If Anne sues Henry, should she be able to enforce his “promise” to give her a place to live with her children? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Henry would argue no because although he promised to let her “have a place” he did not specify for how long. Anne would argue that Henry’s promise that he would let her “have a place to raise her family” means that Henry would give her a place for at least until her family was raised.

**Summary:** The court said that this was not a binding promise; it was a gift, a gratuity. You can revoke a gift any time because it's not a contract. This was a real question in this case. The court never got that far because this is a promise to give a gift. Why are promises to give gifts not binding? Because contract law says so. When I sell you my car it is an exchange. It's in the market. Here there was no exchange, so it wasn't a contract, said the court.

There's an alternative theory called reliancce theory. If he made a promise that she reasonably relied upon there might be a case.

2.	**Giant Steel** Giant Steel, Inc. owns and operates two steel plants in Steeltown. Seventy percent of the residents of Steeltown works for one of these plants. The two plants have operated at a loss for some time. The public affairs officers and corporations managers issue internal memoranda which state: “The continued operation of these plants is absolutely dependent upon their being profit-makers. In the months ahead, we will be calling for the full support of each and every one of you. Your cooperation and assistance is absolutely necessary if our facilities are to continue to operate.” The workers give up Christmas bonuses, work overtime without pay, and do not make any efforts to explore relocation or transfer to other plants. Assume that Giant Steel decides to close the plants claiming “unprofitability.” Local 100 of the steelworkers union claims that the plants are profitable, and challenges the accounting procedures of management. Should Giant Steel’s “promise” to stay open be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No. Giant Steel stated that in order to stay open the plants must make profit and that they would close if they were not profitable, but did not state that they would not close if they were profitable.

**Summary:**  You can't enforce a promise if not enough detail but there can be implied facts; look at details. Was it reasonable to expect something? Disparate bargaining power. Is it employment context, family context, damages? Look at perspective.

3.	**"Surrogate" biological mother agreement to waive parental rights** Jack Higgins (a biochemist) and his wife, Esther Higgins (a pediatrician), want to have children, but Esther Higgins would not consider becoming pregnant because she has multiple sclerosis. Even though there is no clear medical evidence that the pregnancy would harm her, she is afraid of possible health complications. For a fee of $7,500, a private agency introduced the Higginses to Margaret Gordon, a married woman who has two children, and arranged for them to enter into a surrogate parenting agreement. The agreement was set out in a written document. The Higginses agreed to pay Margaret Gordon $10,000 plus expenses if she has a live birth as a result of artificial insemination with Jack Higgins’s semen. Margaret Gordon agreed to the adoption of the child by Jack Higgins and to termination of her parental rights. After giving birth to a daughter, Margaret Gordon decides she cannot go ahead with the arrangement and refuses to give up the baby. Should the agreement be enforced legally? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** No, because although Margaret Gordon promised to give up her parental rights, she had not yet given up these rights when she refused to hand over the baby, and parental rights probably supersede an agreement between private parties. However, Jack Higgins also has parental rights so they should get shared custody.

4. Assume that one day when you were walking, you found a little white dog lying under a tree. The dog appeared ill so you took it home and gave it some water and food. The next day, you decided to take the dog to the vet. The vet examined the dog and told you the dog had pneumonia and it will cost over $500 to treat the dog. You approved treatment and spent your entire savings to pay for the vet bill. The next week, you see a sign that someone has lost a white dog. You take the dog back to its owner and mention the expenses you have incurred in caring for the pet. It turns out that the dog is registered and is a valuable show dog with all kinds of medals. Should the owner have to repay you for the out-of-pocket costs you incurred? Why or why not?

**First thoughts:** Yes, the owner should pay me the expenses I incurred in caring for the pet because the owner has an obligation to care for the pet. If the owner refuses to pay for the pet’s care the owner should give me the dog.  

**Notes from class:** When somebody confers a benefit on someone else's dog is there an obligation to compensate? This is restitution theory.
