1. Read the call of the question and set up broad structure
2. Read the hypo slowly, sentence by sentence
3. Mark issues as you encounter them
4. Broadly outline your answer, using IRAC
- (1) Start by writing an issue statement for each broad issue
- (2) Then, write the corresponding broad rule/policy
5. Make your outline more precise
- (1) Write issue statements for each narrow issue (mini-IRACs)
- (2) Then, add the corresponding narrow rules (in each mini-IRAC)
6. Write your answer
- (1) Analyze each side's argument in each mini-IRAC
- (2) Conclude for each mini-IRAC
7. Conclude for each large issue
8. You're done!
